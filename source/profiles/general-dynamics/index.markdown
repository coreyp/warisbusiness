[![](/images/2011/01/m1a2-abrams-tank-150x84.jpg)](/images/2011/01/m1a2-abrams-tank.jpg)The first Abrams tanks have arrived in Afghanistan and will soon deploy to Helmland province. The US military hopes the tanks protect soldiers and Marines against roadside bombs, and secure victory through "[intimidation and firepower](http://www.marines.mil/unit/1stmardiv/Pages/MarinetankspreparefortheirfirstmissionsinAfghanistan.aspx)." 

Critics have [noted](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/afghanistan/the-tanks-roll-shades-soviet-failure) that approach didn't work for the Soviets. (Witness the historic "[tank graveyard](http://googlesightseeing.com/2006/03/russian-tank-graveyard/)" outside Kabul.)

Whether or not the new approach succeeds, the Abrams deployments are good news for the manufacturers of the tanks, which have also been purchased by Australia, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. [Honeywell](http://honeywell.com/Pages/Home.aspx/) makes the tank engines. [Allison Transmission](http://www.allisontransmission.com/) makes the transmission. But the main contractor behind the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams tanks is General Dynamics, one of the [biggest companies](http://www.warisbusiness.com/top-150-warcorps/) in the war business.

Anonymous testimonials on General Dynamics' [website](http://www.gdls.com/warfighters-forum), ostensibly written by grateful US troops, attribute almsot mystical powers to the Abrams tank:

> DWiz: When the tanks show up, everything goes quiet. You donÕt see anyone messing with us. É
> 
> DesertStormVet21: ThatÕs right DWiz. You find out very quickly that a chaotic situation turns to quiet when a platoon of Abrams rolls in. People take notice and things stop happening.

> General Dynamics Corp has agreed to settle charges that it overbilled the U.S. government for Navy plane and submarine parts by paying $4 million to the government, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Monday. ÉÊAccording to federal prosecutors, the General Dynamics unit defectively manufactured or failed to test parts used in various Navy aircraft, including the C-141 transport plane, and failed to properly manufacture or test components made for Los Angeles and Trident classes of submarines.
