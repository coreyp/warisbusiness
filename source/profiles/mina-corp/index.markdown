> Emails from the company to the Pentagon show that Mina Corp. was using false documents in order to procure jet fuel from Russia. The fraud was deemed necessary becauseÑaccording to the company, at leastÑRussia officially prohibited the export of fuel for military uses. É This fraudulent modus operandi also had the effect of making Mina Corp. seem like an Òindispensable contractor.Ó As the report notes, Ò[n]ot only had the company developed a unique fuel supply system that no other contractor could duplicate, but the Department of Defense had little visibility into how the system actually worked."
