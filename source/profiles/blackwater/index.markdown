### Activities

**Summary**: [ SOURCE](http://www.mensjournal.com/an-american-commando-in-exile/print/) [EDIT](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1627F_y-MCChZAZScP1F-1J3hXwWswPNJu9TsTkoGDMk/viewform?entry.1079455590=BLACKWATER&entry.472841063=summary of activities)

> [US government investigators are] looking for dirt to support what Prince dismisses as "baseless" accusations that run the gamut from negligence, racial discrimination, prostitution, wrongful death, murder, and the smuggling of weapons into Iraq in dog-food containers. â€¦ [Former employees] allege that Blackwater sent the bill for hookers and strippers to Uncle Sam and that [company founder Erik] Prince benefited from this fraud. Prince says there's no merit to the charges: "When we found knucklehead behavior, we fired them."
