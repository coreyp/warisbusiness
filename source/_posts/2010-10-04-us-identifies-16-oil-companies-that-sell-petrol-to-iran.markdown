A new US Government Accountability Office [report](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-967R?source=ra) lists 16 international oil companies that likely sold "refined petroleum products"—gasoline—to Iran in advance of American sanctions that took effect July 1.

Of the companies identified by the GAO, only BP denied that having sold fuel to Iran in the year before the sanctions. The report's authors made no effort to determine whether any of the companies violated US sanctions.

Three of the companies—BP, Total and Emirates National Oil Company—are also US Defense Department contractors, with a combined $2.3 billion in fuel contracts in the past two fiscal years, the overwhelming majority of which are with BP.

The list:
