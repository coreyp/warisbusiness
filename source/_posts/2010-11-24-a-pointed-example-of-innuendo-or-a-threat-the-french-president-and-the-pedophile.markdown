> Turning on a reporter who had asked him a specific question about the arms sales, Mr. Sarkozy then reportedly offered what was apparently intended to be a pointed example of how easy it is to accuse people of crimes based on innuendo, by suggesting that the reporter was a pedophile.


••• All this over a few measly [submarines](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/journalists-say-sarkozy-called-them-pedophiles/?partner=rss&emc=rss  ).


> "[T]he leadership of ISAF doesn't seem to have any idea what it's doing, who it's talking to, and (probably) who it is really killing."


••• Joshua Foust takes this lesson from a strange story in Afghanistan involving [mistaken identity](http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/23/fake_taliban_real_embarrassment ) and "a lot of money."


> The fake chips were sold to many companies, including subcontractors working with big defense suppliers such as Raytheon Missile Systems, BAE Systems, and Northrop Grumman. They were often destined for use in sensitive areas such as missile programs, radiation detectors, and non-military systems such as high-speed trains, the Department of Justice (DoJ) said in court filings.


••• Yet another scam in [Florida](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/211428/woman_helped_sell_fake_chips_to_us_military.html ). Why is it always Florida?

> Five of the suspects, mostly officials of Siemens, are at large. According to the charge sheet, the bribe was siphoned under the guise of vacation and medical bills for ex-ministers and other public officials and their families.


••• Another military contractor settles bribe charges in [Nigeria](http://allafrica.com/stories/201011230832.html ).


> [BAE has always denied bribery](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/66286dce-f73e-11df-9b06-00144feab49a.html#axzz16CEKrDDc) and its settlement agreements with US and UK prosecutors did not include any admissions of corrupt payments.

The [UK Serious Fraud Office] has been trying to encourage more companies to self-report breaches in return for more lenient punishments.


••• So, if a company gets caught paying bribes, they don't have to face serious charges or admit guilt, as long as they pay a "fine." Wouldn't it be simpler to levy a corruption tax?
