**$1.12 trillion** is the [latest official estimate](http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0910/092710cdam1.htm?rss=getoday&oref=rss) of how much the US government has spent to fight its post-9/11 wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and other sundry majority-Islamic nations, according to the Congressional Research Service.

**$3 trillion** is how much Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz [estimated](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702846.html  ) the Iraq and Afghanistan wars would eventually cost US taxpayers.

**$32 billion**—or £20 billion—is how much Stiglitz and his co-author, Linda Bilmes, figured [UK taxpayers](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3419840.ece) would pay toward those wars.

**$21.4 million** is how much the US Air Force has [awarded](http://www.defense.gov//contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4374 ) two subsidiaries of the British contractor BAE Systems to "design a new computer system that is highly resistant to cyber-attack, is resilient in that it continues to render useful services in the face of attacks and faults, and can repair itself"—or in other words, [Skynet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)).

**$6 billion** is the highest estimated [cost](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/bushehr.htm) of the Bushehr nuclear reactor complex in Iran, reportedly the apparent target of the [Stuxnet worm](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency), described as the "[best malware ever](http://defensesystems.com/blogs/digital-conflict/2010/09/stuxnet-worm-stealth-attack.aspx)."
