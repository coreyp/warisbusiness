[![](/images/2011/01/gil-scott-heron-the-revolution-will-not-be-televised-144x150.jpg)](/images/2011/01/gil-scott-heron-the-revolution-will-not-be-televised.jpg)Heads-up: Tomorrow morning I'll make a brief appearance on the Al Jazeera English meta-media show, [The Listening Post](http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/listeningpost/), to comment on mainstream news coverage of the arms trade, and the role of defense trade journals in shaping that coverage. (Watch at 8:30 am GMT on [Al Jazeera English](http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/).)

Then, on Monday evening, I'm scheduled to appear on [The Alyona Show](http://rt.com/programs/alyona-show/) on Russia Today, to discuss the military-industrial complex on the occasion of the anniversary of US President Dwight Eisenhower's [famous farewell speech](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11eisenhower.html?_r=1&src=me&ref=general). (Watch at 6 pm EST on [RT America](http://rt.com/on-air/rt-america-on-air/).)

I'll post those clips when I get the links.Â In the meantime, listen to my interview on the [Boiling Frogs podcast](http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2011/01/12/podcast-show-37/ ), co-hosted by Sibel Edmonds, the prominent [FBI whistleblower](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/09/edmonds200509) and noted [First Amendment defender](http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/633/prmID/172). Edmonds calls War Is Business "groundbreaking" and "the best website of 2010." Thanks!

On the Boiling Frogs show, I referenced a couple of articles that aren't hosted on this site. If anyone's curious, here are links to my stories on Homeland Security [fire hydrant protection](http://www.metrospirit.com/index.php?cat=1211101074307265&ShowArticle_ID=11012205072612553) and the politically connected Sikh sect with a [$500 million security business](http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-5502-khalsa-vs-khalsa.html). These are the kinds of stories I found across the US, which suggested to me that military and security contracting was an undercovered part of American government and the economy.
