Two new reports by US government [auditors](http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/rpts/) reveal, among other things, just how much the Homeland Security Department relies on private contractors. The reports are extremely dry and technical, so a snippet from each should suffice to illustrate the point.

1.)


> In some cases, TSA was dependent on input and feedback from outside contractors...to resolve difficult accounting issues related to the development of its opening balance sheet.


Translation: The TSA's approach to budgeting is akin to handing your local CPA few shoeboxes full of crumpled receipts the day before Tax Day.

2.)


> The Coast Guard is using contractors to fill its acquisition personnel gap...


Translation: The Coast Guard hires contractors to pick other contractors and suppliers. This practice increases "the potential for conflicts of interest"â€”in other words, kickbacks. That's what just happened with American public pension funds, which poured billions of dollars into craptastic mortgage-backed securities on the advice of "[third party placement agents](http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/financial-markets-investing-funds/13594508-1.html)." The results were disastrous.
