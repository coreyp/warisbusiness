![](/images/2010/08/Rep-Jerry-Lewis.jpg)Today, the Naval Air Warfare Center [announced](http://www.defense.gov//contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4356) a $49 million contract for Trident Systems of Fairfax, Virginia. The company will continue its work on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, better known as those flying [death-drones](http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/HK-Drone) from the Terminator movies which, inevitably, will attain self-awareness and kill us all.

But that's not the worst part.

A few years back, [TPM](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2006/06/lewis_faces_probe_but_pals_sta.php) [Muckraker](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/000830.php) and [Harper's](http://harpers.org/archive/2006/06/sb-letitia-white-1149628733) [Magazine](http://harpers.org/archive/2008/02/hbc-90002400) cast light on an orgy of mutual back-scratching involving a California [Congressman](http://jerrylewis.house.gov/), a lobbying firm run by his former aide and a defense contractor named...[Trident Systems](http://www.tridsys.com/index.htm).

The backstory is too convoluted to rehash here, but needless to say, it was a [big ](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/washington/07white.html)[to-do](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060702275.html) that continues to make [headlines](http://www.pe.com/localnews/politics/stories/PE_News_Local_S_lewis25.46f636b.html). The takeaway: Trident founder Nick Karangelen helped buy a $1 million townhouse for a former aide of US Rep. Jerry Lewis (pictured) after Lewis' former aide, now a lobbyist, helped secure millions of dollars in federal spending for Trident.

One would think the US military might hesitate to shovel tens of millions of dollars toward at a company whose recent actions bordered on bribery, for work on a weapons system that in many ways symbolizes both the essential [blindness](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/opinion/17exum.html?_r=1) of the US strategy in "AfPak" and the [dehumanizing](http://www.military.com/news/article/predator-pilots-suffering-war-stress.html?col=1186032310810&wh=news) effects of high-tech warfare.

One would be wrong, on both counts.
