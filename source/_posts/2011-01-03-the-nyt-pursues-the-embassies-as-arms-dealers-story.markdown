> [The US military] is working with Harris Corp. to adapt ESPN's technique of tagging key moments in National Football League videotape to the war zone. Just as a sportscaster can call up a series of archived quarterback blitzes as soon as a player is sacked on the field, an analyst in Afghanistan can retrieve the last month's worth of bombings in a particular stretch of road with the push of a button, officials said.


••• [Does this mean](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/01/AR2011010102690_2.html) ESPN will earn a royalty every time an IED hits a Humvee?

> [Office of Market Surveillance chief Joseph J. Cella III] said the investigation ultimately revealed no trading that the SEC thought was done with foreknowledge of 9/11. In addition, Cella said there are no question marks out there where the SEC could not get sufficient information, such as trading by an offshore company, whose owners could not be identified. To the contrary, all suspicious trades were checked out, and the SEC satisfied itself that the traders had no advance knowledge of 9/11.


••• Via Cryptome ([pdf]( http://cryptome.org/nara/sec/sec-03-0916.pdf)), the 9/11 Commission summary of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that found no evidence of any traders profiting from foreknowledge of the attacks, by short-selling the stocks of "industries harmed by the attacks (such as airlines, travel industry, or WTC tenants) and [buying stock in] those who might benefit from the attacks (such as defense contractors or security companies)."
