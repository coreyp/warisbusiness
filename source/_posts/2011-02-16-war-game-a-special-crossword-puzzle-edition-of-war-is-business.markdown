Dave Maass here, stand-in for Corey Pein, who is away, doing lord-of-war knows what in a faraway land ... When I was a kid, I remember teachers using homemade crossword puzzles to help us study our vocabulary words. I ran with that concept this week, and here's the resulting military-industrial-complex crossword puzzle. I'm licensing this under Creative Commons, so feel free to share, re-blog and all that, as long as you link back to WIB.

I'll throw the answers online in a couple of days (it would be a giveaway to link 'em up front). In the meantime, if you wanted to show us how smart you are, you can email your completed crossword to davemaass [at] gmail [dot] com. We'll give the first entrant to finish it correctly some kind of official award for excellence in defense-industry intelligence.
