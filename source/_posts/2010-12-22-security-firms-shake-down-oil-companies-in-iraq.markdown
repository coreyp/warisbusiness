> "Halliburton often receives...'questionable' reports of vulnerability of employees to kidnapping and ransom. [Halliburton's manager for Iraq] recently saw an internal memo from their security company which tasked its employees to emphasize the persistent danger faced by IOCs [international oil companies]."


••• If the [mercenary "mafia"](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/21/wikileaks-cables-iraq-security-firms) in Iraq have the cojones to run [this racket](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/245068) on a company as large and powerful as Halliburton, would they even blink before ripping off a government bureaucrat?

> The company did not admit to any corruption, pleading guilty only to a trivial charge of keeping inadequate accounting records. In return, BAE and its officers were extraordinarily given blanket immunity from any offences before 2004 – whether admitted to or not. A cap was placed on the total amount BAE would pay to settle the litigation – whether as a fine or in compensation.


••• How the UK government office in charge of prosecuting corporate fraud [punted](http://fcpaprofessor.blogspot.com/2010/12/uk-judge-reluctantly-accepts-loosely.html) on one of the largest fraud cases in recent years.


> The report, which follows an eight-month investigation into the jet fuel contracts, found no evidence of corrupt ties between Mina Corp. or Red Star and the families of Kyrgyz leaders. Yet it cautioned that a lack of proper oversight and a neglect of America's broader interests in the region had often left Washington blind to "political, diplomatic and geopolitical collateral consequences." These include the ouster of two Kyrgyz governments in popular revolts stirred in part by anger over alleged jet fuel corruption and also U.S. ties with Moscow.


••• US Congressional investigators [fail to solve](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/20/AR2010122006512.html) the $2 billion mystery of the Manas Transit Center fuel contract, but conclude that corruption may have negative consequences. Score!
