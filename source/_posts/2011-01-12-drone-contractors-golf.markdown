> How many other criminal suspects are hiding out on US military bases overseas? And why was it so easy for a man like Phillips to slip through the safeguards that are in place? What company or companies did Phillips work for? And what did he do with the presumable pile of money he made over the past near-decade?


••• Alleged child rapist avoids arrest for [seven years](http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/01/contractor-hid-iraq-seven-years-over-us-rape-charge) by working as a military contractor in Iraq.


> La Fuerza Aérea Argentina (FAA) reportó hoy el robo de cerca de 20 mil municiones de armas de varios calibres en un depósito militar, en las afueras de esta capital.

> The clause in question states that, “There shall be no further investigations or prosecutions of any member of the BAE Systems Plc group for any conduct preceding 5 February 2010”.… This clause became public only when the terms of the settlement agreement were read out in open court…

> The Afghan Media in 2010 report said total annual media revenues amounted to between $77m and $96m. Of that, $50m was driven by commercial advertising revenues, with 19 per cent funded by the military, and the rest made up of private and public funding.


••• From the way that's written, it's unclear whether that works out to $9.5 million worth of [military propaganda](http://www.thenational.ae/business/media/top-adman-says-afghan-advertising-revenue-to-rise-at-least-10-a-year) in Afghanistan last year, or $18 million.

••• A libertarian think-tank deconstructs the Pentagon "[cuts that aren't](http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/gatess-cuts-that-arent/  )."


> Defense auditors found that sampling travel vouchers submitted by Northrop Grumman, the [surveillance drone] contractor, included $206,000 in unallowable travel vouchers for a golf outing and air shows in Washington, Paris and Singapore.


••• That's one-fifth of a million dollars in [junkets](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/10/AR2011011005953.html) from a _sample_ of receipts.


> Military aid to Yemen would reach $250 million in 2011 alone, U.S. officials said, and Clinton said there will be additional development aid.


••• [Drones first]( http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/11/world/main7234112.shtml), then golf courses.


> Israeli drivers, watch out.


••• [Blackwater, slippery as ever](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/01/is-blackwater-heading-for-the-holy-land/), is coming to Jerusalem.
