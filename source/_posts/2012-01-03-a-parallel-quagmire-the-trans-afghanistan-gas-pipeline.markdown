[![](/images/2012/01/tapi-ipi-pipelines-afghanistan-pakistan-india-iran-turkmenistan-300x189.gif)](/images/2012/01/tapi-ipi-pipelines-afghanistan-pakistan-india-iran-turkmenistan.gif)The perpetually [postponed](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/world/asia/american-commander-in-afghanistan-john-allen-hints-at-post-2014-military-presence.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all) U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan tracks a little too closely with timelines for another [fubar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR) project, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline.

TAPI, as the pipeline is known, ought to be called TBD. It's been a Big Oil dream since the mid-1990s, and a decade's-long American military presence in the region has brought it no closer to reality. The Afghan news outfit Killid Media [reported](http://tkg.af/english/reports/political/731-how-long-before-gas-in-pipeline?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+tkg_english+%28English%29) yesterday that "Little has happened on the TAPI natural gas project involving four countries a year after [an] agreement was signed by the governments."



> Planners are promising the project could be in operation by 2016. … Work which was delayed by security concerns will **start from early 2012 and finish in two years**…



Are the pipeline planners scheduling based on the projected 2014 timeline for U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, or vice-versa? Does it matter? Either way, there are signs that the U.S. government is doubling down on the project as Pakistani leaders have indicated they might prefer a competing pipeline proposed to connect Pakistan and a U.S. adversary, Iran.

Pakistan's Express Tribune [reports](http://tribune.com.pk/story/308650/wielding-soft-power-us-offers-to-finance-tapi-gas-pipeline/):



> Addressing students of Lahore University of Management Sciences…US ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter had termed Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline deal unfeasible. A **viable alternative**, in his view, was the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project via Afghanistan. …

Sources inform The Express Tribune that the Export-Import Bank (EIB) of the United States as well as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), an “independent” US agency, **have offered Pakistan financing for TAPI**.




The U.S. is also the key shareholder in the Asian Development Bank, another financing agency for TAPI, as W.I.B. [noted previously](http://www.warisbusiness.com/320/features/bullet-points/hillary-hawks-boeing-gear-to-india/).

But promises of more American dollars may ring hollow, as [the following letter](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vCPMCIT2MsoJ:www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Editorials/17-Sep-2011/Lets-say-No-to-US+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) in a prominent English-language Pakistani newspaper about the competing pipeline projects suggests. 

"Pakistan," the letter begins, will "not take any dictation from anyone."



> **The gas pipeline project with Iran is a lifeline for us** for overcoming the energy crisis. The US energy team…came up with a **strange demand** that Pakistan should abandon this project and instead offered assistance for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project (TAPI) as an alternative option. …

Washington has already successfully persuaded India to jump out of the deal, leaving Iran and Pakistan to implement the project. It is an undeniable fact that **Pakistan has no cheaper and safer option** than getting the Iranian gas. The laying of the pipeline on our side of the border must be taken up immediately, since **Iran has already constructed their part of the pipeline up to Pakistani border**. Any effort to undo this vital project would be a criminal act against national interests.



Catch that? While the American-backed pipeline might be done in two years' time, the Iranian-backed pipeline is already built up to the border with Pakistan, just waiting for the hookup.

 Happy New Year!
