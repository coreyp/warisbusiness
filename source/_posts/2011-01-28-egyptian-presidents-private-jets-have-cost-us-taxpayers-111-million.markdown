[![](/images/2011/01/humvee-army-catalog-photo-150x103.jpg)](/images/2011/01/humvee-army-catalog-photo.jpg)WIth all the worldwide [news coverage](http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/) of street protests in Egypt, conflict academic [Chris Albon](http://christopheralbon.com/) makes an astute point via Twitter: "Want to know why foreign military assistance is often a bad idea? Imagine video of Egyptian protesters being crushed by US-built APCs."

As it happens, the anti-riot trucks favored by Egyptian police bear the logo of an Italian company, [Iveco SpA](http://web.iveco.com/Pages/welcome.html#).*

Albon's concern is not misplaced, however. The US government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to equip the Egyptian security forces with high-tech military hardware.

<!-- more -->But unless things get really, really bad there, it's unlikely that any big-ticket American military hardware will be used directly against the Egyptian demonstrators. A selection of Defense Department contracts dating to the mid-1990s reveals weapons sales to Egypt that include a Black Hawk helicopters (Sikorsky), a dizzying variety of missiles (Raytheon), Abrams tanks (General Dynamics), Humvees (AM General Corp.) and all manner of ammunition.

![](/images/2011/01/hosni-mubarak-egypt-132x150.jpg)Now, _if_ through some incredible circumstance Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak decides to flee the country, Ã  la [Ben Ali](http://www.warisbusiness.com/people/zine-el-abidine-ben-ali/), there's a good chance his first-class flight would come courtesy of the American taxpayer.

Pentagon contracts show that the US government has spent at least $111,160,328 to purchase and maintain Mubarak's fleet of nine Gulfstream business jets. (For those keeping score, Gulfstream is a subsidiary of General Dynamics.)

Amateur planespotters have [photographed](http://www.jetphotos.net/viewphoto.php?id=6066699) several of the planes around the world. Mubarak also apparently travels in a Airbus A340; I have no idea who put up the money for that one.

* This tidbit also comes via Twitter, thanks to eagle-eyed Foreign Policy magazine managing editor [Blake Hounshell](http://twitter.com/blakehounshell); Hounshell also noticed a [report](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28diplo.html) that Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak once "commandeered a bus that had been bought with money from the United States Agency for International Development and that had been meant to carry children to school."
