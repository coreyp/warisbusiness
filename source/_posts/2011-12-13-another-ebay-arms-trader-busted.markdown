![](/images/2011/12/geoff-roose-oregon-national-guard-150x115.jpg)I just posted on this over at [Willamette Week](http://wweek.com/portland/blog-27977-corvallis-man-in-ebay-arms-case-was-three-tour-army-veteran.html). Geoffrey B. Roose, a self-described three-tour U.S. Army veteran from Oregon, was arrested last week following a sting by Homeland Security agents who stumbled across his eBay store, where he was selling restricted (and apparently stolen) Trijicon military rifle scopes.

Roose's eBay username: "mr.f.u.up." 

Investigators got a hold of Roose's emails. In one, he reacted defensively to a prospective customer on eBay who pointed out that he appeared to be dealing in stolen government property.

"You know what man," Roose began,



> I spent three tours overseas and it isn't my responsibility to police the world. … Take a load off and try worrying about your life, not stupid federal ITAR rules or stolen property. There is more government property wasted in a dumpster overseas then [sic] you will ever see on ebay. Sorry to be rude, but it's the god honest truth. … Check feedback before you accuse someone of potentially having stolen property. Deal with it, it happens. It's your tax dollars.
