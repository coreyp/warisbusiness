![](/images/2011/02/rssfail-114x150.jpg)My apologies to those readers whose [RSS subscriptions](http://www.warisbusiness.com/feed/) to this site were overwhelmed with gibberish this morning. The good news is, I'm stepping up the news aggregation on War Is Business, which will mean more frequent updates. The bad news is, in fiddling around with the levers and dials behind the curtain, I accidentally published a dozen-odd posts drafts, gunking up this site's feed and quite possibly revealing some state secrets. 

I've also added some new navigation features to the right-hand column. The new menus are a little on the ugly side right now, but they aim to make the site more useful as a directory and they will, with time, get prettier.
