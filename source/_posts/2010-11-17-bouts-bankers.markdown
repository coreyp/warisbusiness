![](/images/2010/11/viktor-bout-tv-jail-150x134.jpg)Arms dealer extrordanaire Viktor Bout is supposed to be [arraigned today](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/world/asia/17thai.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss) in a US federal courthouse in Manhattan, following his [extradition](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/11/bout-time/) from Thailand.

The indictment filed against Bout earlier this year is filled with details about his complex worldwide operation. Following an international freeze on Bout's companies and assets in 2004, he allegedly created a new network of shell companies to keep his business going.

In addition to illegal arms trading, Bout and his associate, Richard A Chichakli, also stand accused of money-laundering. The indictment names the banks that allegedly facilitated the transfer of at least $1.7 million on behalf of Bout's enterprise. Some of those banks are household names.

<!-- more -->Below are the names of a few of Bout's alleged shell companies, along with their account numbers at relevant banks; the feds have requested that any assets connected with those accounts be forfeited.
