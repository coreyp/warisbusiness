![](/images/2010/09/blackwater-xe-flag-logo-small-150x150.jpg)The "Xe Services" [rebranding](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100675028) campaign evidently wasn't enough to improve the "[optics](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html)" of America's most infamous mercenary corporation, Blackwater.

On Friday, Jim Risen and Mark Mazzetti of the The New York Times [reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/world/middleeast/04blackwater.html) that Blackwater established a network of front companies to ensure that company founder Erik Prince keeps winning government contracts, even after its brand name has become [synonymous](http://www.amazon.com/Blackwater-Rise-Worlds-Powerful-Mercenary/dp/1560259795) with [shadiness](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/01/blackwater-201001), [brutality](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/1/29/exclusiveblackwaters_youngest_victim_father_of_9) and [murder](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/world/asia/08blackwater.html).

The NYT kindly linked to a copy of the US Senate Armed Services Committee hearing transcript ([pdf](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/getdoc.pdf?ref=middleeast)). But one key piece of information was missing from the story (and illegible in the source documents): The names of the 30 Blackwater/Xe front companies.

No worries—I got 'em.

[/visitor]![](/images/2010/09/blackwater-front-flow-chart-SASC.jpg)In the Feb. 24 committee hearing on Blackwater front companies, US Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, lectured Blackwater executive Fred Roitz on its whack-a-mole corporate strategy:


> "It is not so simple, Mr. Roitz, as changing your name. If it could be so simple... The way you restore your reputation is not by changing your name. The way you restore your reputation is by changing the way you do business...

"I think you are wasting a lot of money on lawyers changing names. I think you could invest that money in quality control and accountability and probably do much better for your company than just thinking you can do it by changing a name."


These names may be a little more than a year out of date, since the relevant page in the SASC hearing report is dated Aug. 7, 2009. Nevertheless, they offer a good list of places to start digging. (Only about one-third of these names are currently listed on Blackwater's lengthy [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_Worldwide).)

Each of the following companies, and their respective officers, may be tied to further contracts with the US government—and, given Blackwater's history, god-knows-what else.

From the NYT:


> While it is not clear how many of those businesses won contracts, at least three had deals with the United States military or the Central Intelligence Agency, according to former government and company officials…

The network of companies — which includes several businesses located in offshore tax havens — allowed Blackwater to obscure its involvement in government work from contracting officials or the public, and to assure a low profile for any of its classified activities…


What new front companies have sprouted in the last year? Where do they own property? What contracts have they won? Where are they operating? Which politicians have they given money to? Piecing those facts together is part of the [mission](http://www.warisbusiness.com/about-wib/) of this site.

Since several of the Blackwater fronts explicitly concern aviation, I started by searching Federal Aviation Administration records for craft registered to any of the following companies. The results of that search—at least, the 79 aircraft most clearly linked to a Blackwater affiliate—follow the list of companies below.

This could be very useful information. Retracing the path of aircraft thought to be used by intelligence agencies and their contractors—through their unique FAA N-numbers—is how investigative reporters like [Stephen Grey](http://www.stephengrey.com/books/) began to unravel the US practice of "extraordinary rendition" of terrorist suspects.
