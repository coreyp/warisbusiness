••• [Pish-posh!](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/the-tyranny-of-defense-inc/8342) The American worker is free to enlist at any time.


> Camp Bucca, the sprawling former prison once run by the U.S. military in southern Iraq, will be turned into a commercial center with offices, warehouses, aviation and fuel services to support investors.


••• [Alternatively, the American worker could apply to stock warehouse shelves in Basra](http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16903350?nclick_check=1 ).


> After shooting the man, referred to in court as Karimullah, Langdon then tried to stage a fake Taliban attack in which he had colleagues shoot randomly into the air before he threw a hand grenade inside the vehicle in which Karimullah lay dead.

••• [The "scary" militarization of aid](http://www.thenation.com/article/157439/real-december-review-afghanistan).
