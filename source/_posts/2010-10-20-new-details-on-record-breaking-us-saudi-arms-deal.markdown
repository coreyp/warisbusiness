[![](/images/2010/10/gates-Muyaya-saudi-arabia-300x199.jpg)](http://www.centcom.mil/en/news/u-s-seeks-saudi-help-with-iran-sanctions.html)The US Defense Department just sent Congress an inventory of the actual weapons the Obama administration intends to include in a proposed [$60 billion arms sale](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/09/obama-arms-deal/) to Saudi Arabia.

The deal was divided into four parts for presentation to Congress [and the press](http://www.dsca.mil/sc_news/).

That much money buys a mind-numbingly long list of weaponry, which I haven't yet  bothered to translate from DoD-ese.

I have, however, pasted the choice bits together after the jump.
