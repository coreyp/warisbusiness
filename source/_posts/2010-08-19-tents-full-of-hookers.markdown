Brooks is on trial in New York.




Despite ample evidence of Brooks' criminally poor taste, including the allegations above, the charges against him concern [business fraud](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/nyregion/27fraud.html).

Fortunately for Brooks, one strong, clear voice in the US news media has taken his side. That would be Stephen Colbert, who recently named the misunderstood "[lifesaving legend](http://www.davidhbrooks.biz/)" his "[Alpha Dog of the Week](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/343094/august-02-2010/alpha-dog-of-the-week---david-h--brooks)."

Clearly, the honor is deserved:


![](/images/2010/08/DHBbuckleew.jpg)His treatment in the news media aside, the revelations from Brooks' trial raise an obvious question:


Why on earth did US taxpayers give his company over _$1.2 billion_?

Was it just so he could hire prostitutes for his employees? [Bet on ponies](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/02/the-brooks-brothers-find-trouble-and-harness-racing-holds-its-breath/35245/) at the track?

Answering questions like that is the whole point of this website. (By the way: Welcome! Come back soon.) Some answers will come once judge and jury decide Brooks' fate.

In the meantime, W.I.B. got proactive, and started a Facebook Causes page in his honor. Please take a moment to join "'[Tents Full of Hookers' for War Profiteers](http://www.causes.com/causes/518993)."

It's the least you can do, really.
