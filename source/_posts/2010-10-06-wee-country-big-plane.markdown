![](/images/2010/10/yahoo-arabic-150x47.jpg)Yesterday, the Pentagon notified the US Congress of two pending foreign military sales worth $791 million. See a headline anywhere?

The first, for $98 million, will further develop the "Iraqi Defense Network," which is supposed to help the US-backed Iraqi military migrate from Hotmail and Yahoo to a more secure form of communication ([seriously](http://www.usf-iraq.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=5102&Itemid=41)).

The price includes a user manual, for what it's worth, a warranty.

<!-- more --> ![](/images/2010/10/steven-r-loranger-ITT-corporation-99x150.jpg)![](/images/2010/10/Howard-L-Lance-harris-120x150.jpg) Two lucky contractors will share the Iraqi network deal: ITT Corporation and Harris Corporation of McLean, Virginia and White Plains, New York, respectively. Both companies are on [W.I.B.'s list](http://www.warisbusiness.com/top-150-warcorps/) of top US military contractors.

ITT's president and CEO, [Steven R. Loranger](http://www.itt.com/about/leadership/directors/ ), is pictured left. Harris' chairman and CEO, [Howard L. Lance](http://www.harris.com/board-of-directors.html ), is pictured right.

If you still have trouble telling them apart, with their discreet frames, dark jackets receding hairlines and smirk-smiles, remember: Loranger is the one showing teeth.

The second arms sale, for $693 million, will give Kuwait its first C-17 Globemaster III, manufactured by Boeing.

That particular transport plane is big enough to fit half the country, and so expensive that the sale will comprise roughly one-seventh of the annual budget of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense. Why do they need it? According the Pentagon notice:


> The KAF is tasked with relief support, humanitarian disaster and peacekeeping missions, as well as transporting dignitaries and cultural assets to various regional and international destinations.


Dignitary transport...cultural assets...Kuwait... [this all sounds familiar](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-441535/Camillas-high-heels-leave-huge-carbon-footprint.html).
