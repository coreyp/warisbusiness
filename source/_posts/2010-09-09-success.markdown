[![](/images/2010/08/WIB-corazon-flyer-FB-v2-150x150.jpg)](/images/2010/08/WIB-corazon-flyer-FB-v2.jpg)Last night's launch party and fundraiser was good times.

Thanks to all those who endured a PowerPoint presentation in the middle of a party.

Thanks, also, to everyone who showed up to dance, donate or just say goodbye as I leave New Mexico. Posting will be light here for the next week, until I've finished moving.

<!-- more -->Thanks to the DJs who donated their time: [Sattva Ananda](http://www.reverbnation.com/artist/song_details/1663752), [DJ Melanie Moore](http://www.myspace.com/djmelaniemoore) and DJ Safiyah, who all played fantastic and creative sets. Book them!

Thanks to all the artists who donated their work for auction: [Stephen Auger](http://www.zanebennettgallery.com/artist_galleries/auger-s/augergallerynew.htm), [Joanne Lefrak](http://www.joannelefrak.com/Site/Site/index.html), [Willy Richardson](http://www.willyrichardson.com/), [David Solomon](http://www.dsoloarts.com/) and [Jolene Yazzie](http://asdzaan.com/). Two pieces sold, by [Chace Haynes](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=164698517936&index=1) and Max Olivas. The other pieces should've sold, because they were all really cool. Keep an eye out for these artists' next gallery shows, and check out their online portfolios.

Thanks to [Corazón](http://www.corazonsantafe.com/) for the space, [Backroad Pizza](http://www.backroadpizza.com/) for deliciousness and my good friends who volunteered.

Between donations at the door and the art sales, the event raised enough money for [Global Conflict Research, Inc](http://www.warisbusiness.com/about-wib/)., the non-profit affiliate of this website, to cover the costs of monthly internet access for the better part of the next year; having that basic overhead cost covered will make it possible to continue to publish real-time investigative reporting on this website.
