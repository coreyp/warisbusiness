> A security company has recruited two former senior civil servants, [sparking an outcry](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/dec/26/g4s-hires-ex-mandarins?CMP=twt_gu) about the "revolving door" between Whitehall and the company.


••• Only two? [Meh](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/12/rent-a-generals-and-the-militarization-of-the-economy/).


> I think a more important question should be, "Why did we have [39 Generals or Admirals of 3+ stars retired in 2007](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/specials/122610_generals_list/) and that wasn't front-page news?"  After all, while I'm not old enough to remember it, I do know that giving Eisenhower and Bradley and other leaders of WW2 combat commands got 4th stars after, say, beating the Nazis on their home turf.  Why do we have so many former high-ranking officers now that 39 can retire in one year without creating a massive stir?

> The 2010 military [spending] bill, for example, contained expenditures that the Pentagon did not want: $2.5 billion for C-17 transport planes; $825 million for all-terrain vehicles; $732 million for other planes, and $500 million for a second engine for the F-35 jet.

> 2010 a mixed bag for Indian defence research


••• An [epic fail](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2010-a-mixed-bag-for-Indian-defence-research/articleshow/7189273.cms) for "one of India's most touted missiles."


> US state department spokesman Mark Toner on Tuesday [dismissed allegations](http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=130541  ) that the US had sent mercenaries to Côte d’Ivoire to oust Mr Gbagbo as "absurd".


••• On the other hand, Gbagbo [knows something about mercenaries](http://www.innercitypress.com/ban5cote122910.html).
