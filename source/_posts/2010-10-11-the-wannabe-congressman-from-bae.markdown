[![](/images/2010/10/richard-ashooh-bae-115x150.jpg)](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rich-Ashooh/312543398763)A follow-up on [that last item](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/10/bae-buys-good-press-and-silence/): Nearly one-third of the $105,000 that employees of BAE Systems have contributed to US political campaigns this past year went to [Richard E Ashooh](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rich-Ashooh/312543398763), a Republican candidate for Congress in New Hampshire.

Ashooh, as it happens, is BAE's in-house lobbyist in that state, where the British-owned military contractor is the largest private employer.

He reportedly took a leave of absence to attempt to install himself in the US House of Representatives. After serving—who, it's not clear—for a few terms, he would've been eligible for lifetime, taxpayer-supported healthcare and, presumably, quadrupled his salary on returning to BAE.

Guess which newspaper endorsed Ashooh's [failed](http://www.wmur.com/politics/25010214/detail.html) candidacy last month? That's right—[the same paper](http://www.theunionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Ashooh+for+Congress:+Best+person+to+fight+for+NH&articleId=1a4492e5-1caa-4e5e-b4ef-54e193f3862d) whose publisher recently returned from a BAE-funded golf trip to Afghanistan.

Last year, Ashooh [told](http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=A+third+GOP+candidate+eyes+U.S.+House+race&articleId=4ce284f5-3acd-4d9d-b469-09aa4e1cefc1) a Union-Leader reporter


> that if elected, he would ensure "that there is no conflict" but would not recuse himself from votes that affect the company, which is among the state's largest employers.

"Recusing myself from those issues would be recusing myself from a major part of the economic fabric of the state," he said.

He said he would be sure that any votes he casts have no "personal impact" on him and promised to be "completely, unreservedly objective" on votes that could affect BAE.


Objective, sure.

Objectively speaking, that earth-tone sweater doesn't make Ashooh look any less like a shark.

Ashooh [narrowly lost](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/855060-196/calls-finally-came-to-guinta.html) the eight-way primary race, coming in second in a field of eight.

Here's the full list of BAE-backed candidates and campaign committees in the 2010 federal election cycle:
