[![](/images/2011/01/hussein-tantawi-egypt-150x150.jpg)](/images/2011/01/hussein-tantawi-egypt.jpg)When the two military leaders met in May 2009 to discuss "a wide range of security issues," Egyptian Defence Minister Hussein Tantawi presented US Defense Secretary Robert Gates with a set of gifts. They included a shotgun (with five bullets), a decorative rug and a gilded photo album.

With a confidence that, in retrospect, seems dubious, Gates [said](http://www.centcom.mil/ur/news/gates-praises-egypt-seeks-saudi-support-in-pakistan) "he looks forward to expanding the two countries’ military-to-military relationships in ways that promote regional stability."

Five months after that meeting, the Pentagon announced it would sell a new batch of two dozen F-16 fighter aircraft to Egypt—a $3.2 billion deal that is among the most recent of a long string of arms deliveries from America to its North African ally. These F-16s, according to the Pentagon announcement ([pdf](http://www.dsca.mil/pressreleases/36-b/2009/Egypt_%2009-34.pdf)) would support "Egypt’s legitimate need for its own self-defense."

Today the Egyptian Air Force [buzzed](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/930467--fighter-jets-swoop-over-cairo-as-chaos-spreads-prisoners-escape) a crowd of demonstrators in Cairo with fighter jets much like those supplied, over a period of decades, by the US. It was a tactical decision that bore little relation to "legitimate" national "self-defense," although it can be construed as a desperate attempt to defend Hosni Mubarak's three-decade hold on the presidency.

<!-- more -->America, of course, is not the only supplier to the Egyptian military. But it is the largest, and anti-government demonstrators have been vocal in calling on Barak Obama to withdraw US support for Mubarak. (A live Al Jazeera English report identified the planes that buzzed the crowd in Cairo as F-16s, the backbone of Egypt's Air Force, but they [just as easily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Air_Force) could've been Russian-made MiGs.)

Neither was Gates the only American official to receive a gift from an Egyptian military officer. The following list of "Gifts to Federal Employees from Foreign Government Sources" was published on January 18 in the Federal Register. In each case, the gifts were accepted because refusal "would cause embarrassment to donor and [the] U.S. Government."

[![](/images/2011/01/biden-mubarak-300x199.jpg)](/images/2011/01/biden-mubarak.jpg)President Hosni Mubarak gave Vice President Joe Biden an etched silver octagonal box. First Lady Suzanne Mubarak gave Michelle Obama an alabaster bowl, "sterling silver chains with charms" and a set of tablecloths. However, the most generous Egyptian leader, the records show, appears to have been Lieutenant General Samy Enan.

The gifts don't mean very much in and of themselves—and certainly don't imply a quid-pro-quo for the arms shipments heading the other direction. But now, as the Obama administration attempts to gingerly distance itself from Mubarak, this list of diplomatic swag underscores the American government's long and friendly relationship with a now-unfashionable dictatorship.

Some of the recipients and givers appear to have been redacted.
