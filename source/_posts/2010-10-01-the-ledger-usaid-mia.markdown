**![](/images/2010/10/zahid-elahi-DAI-pakistan.jpg)$5.2 million** is how much of a $329 million USAID contract with [Development Alternatives, Inc](http://www.dai.com/about/executive_team.php)., may have wound up in Taliban hands, [according to](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-fg-taliban-payoffs-20101001,0,1379818.story) [an audit](http://turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/09/30/us_tax_money_goes_to_taliban). Zahid Elahi, pictured, is DAI's Pakistan director; the Los Angeles Times says US government auditors found signs of "pervasive fraud" in the company's Jalalabad office.

**$10 billion** is the size of a five-year US State Department security contract to be shared with Blackwater's [latest front company](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/09/names-named-the-30-blackwater-front-companies-%E2%80%94-and-some-of-their-aircraft/), "International Development Solutions," [Wired reports](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/exclusive-blackwater-wins-piece-of-10-billion-merc-deal/).

**$1 million** is how much legal liability the US government could accept on behalf of a defense contractor before notifying Congress, under a [new bill](http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1725:blumenauer-schrader-wyden-merkley-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-rein-in-secretive-war-contracting-process&catid=48:2010-press-releases-new) proposed by US Rep. Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. He's targeting [KBR](http://www.warisbusiness.com/tag/kbr/).

**$100 million** is the threshold for Congressional notification of "other defense articles and services" traded between the [US and UK](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/09/148478.htm  ), under the two countries' [defense agreement](http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/UsukDefenceTreatyNearsImplementation.htm  ), now up for renewal.

**$600 million** is how much more the US Veterans Affairs Department spent on [medical prosthetics](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-935) in 2009 than in 2005; spending on prosthetics grew 10 percent faster than the number of veterans in the VA program.
