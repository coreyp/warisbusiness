<!-- more -->The evening will start around 7 p.m. with an art auction and stencil party (T-shirts, anyone?). Of course, I'll talk about W.I.B., but briefly.




If you can't make it, consider chipping in via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZQR4HMAXD47N2).
