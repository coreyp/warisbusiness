> “You’re not going to get intelligence in a war zone from Ward Cleaver or Florence Nightingale.”


••• Why America provides protection to a [top Afghan opium trafficker](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/world/asia/12drugs.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all).


> Agility, a Kuwaiti firm charged in November 2009 with overbilling food contracts worth $8.5 billion over four years for troops, civilians and contractors in Iraq, Jordan and Kuwait, recently received a $26 million, six-month contract extension.


••• Why some shady outfits get to [keep their Pentagon contracts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/12/AR2010121203797.html?wprss=rss_nation).


> While McKeon's views may not endear him to tea partiers or defense reformers, they are in lockstep with the neoconservative defense establishment, which claims that giving ground on defense will lead to America's inevitable decline.


••• Why the next US Congress [won't take on](http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/12/buck-mckeon-armed-services-afghanistan) military overspending.


> <!-- more -->[Wojciech Chodan] said it was "unjust and oppressive" to "haul him out of his domestic bliss" with his wife and send him to the US… He admitted one charge of conspiring to bribe the Nigerians to secure $6bn gas contracts.


••• A British businessman who worked for a subsidiary of Halliburton at a time when it was led by Dick Cheney [admits](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2010/dec/07/british-businessman-guilty-us-bribery-trial) to having bribed Nigerian officials.


> "Shell is everywhere. They have an eye and an ear in every ministry of Nigeria. They have people on the payroll in every community, which is why they get away with everything. They are more powerful than the Nigerian government."


••• If it's not one thing, [it's another](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying).


> No other state has produced more guns seized by police in the brutal Mexican drug wars than Texas. In the Lone Star State, no other city has more guns linked to Mexican crime scenes than Houston. And in the Texas oil town, no single independent dealer stands out more for selling guns traced from south of the border than Bill Carter.


••• An employee at Carter's flagship store [finally thought to call police](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/12/AR2010121204149.html?wprss=rss_print) "[w]hen one of the traffickers purchased eight Bushmaster .223-caliber sniper rifles for nearly $9,000."
