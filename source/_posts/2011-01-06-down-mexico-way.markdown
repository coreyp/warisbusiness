![](/images/2011/01/nra-armed-with-pride-150x148.jpg)If you're too busy to read the Washington Post's [excellent series](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/guns/) on how American gun dealers supply Mexican drug cartels, well, then shame on you. 

But do take the time to listen to [this Fresh Air interview](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/guns/) with one of the series' authors.
