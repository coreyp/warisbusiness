> [Cyber security is a major growth industry](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/01/101101fa_fact_hersh?currentPage=all#ixzz13MfZjWMm)…  [Retired Vice-Admiral J. Michael] McConnell is now an executive vice-president of Booz Allen Hamilton, a major defense contractor. Two months after McConnell testified before the Senate, Booz Allen Hamilton landed a thirty-four-million-dollar cyber contract.


••• Remarkable: In this hacktackular age, some journalists actually check facts and [don't bring bodyguards](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/25/3047091.htm) to press conferences.


> Many of the companies apparently felt no sense of accountability. Contractors with a Romanian company called Danubia Global killed three Iraqis in Falluja in 2006, another report said, then refused to answer questions on the episode, citing a company policy not to provide information to investigators.

“It is assessed that this drunken group of individuals were out having a good time and firing their weapons,” the incident report concluded.


••• The New York Times [rounds up](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24contractors.html?partner=rss&emc=rss) sketchy contractor-related incidents from the well-coordinated Wikileaks release of [old US military reports](http://twitter.com/#!/coreypein/status/28445372961) from Iraq.


> In 2006 and 2007, [McGuinn’s company](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/american-iran-embargo-undermined-as-smugglers-show-way-to-ship-made-in-usa.html ) was negotiating deals worth more than $4 million to purchase 17 helicopter engines from Rolls-Royce in the U.S., according to the indictment. All but two of the dual-use engines reached Iran, according to the Justice Department, and some went to a company the U.S. says is controlled by Iran’s defense ministry.


<!-- more -->••• [Variations on a theme](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/10/bp-puts-us-military-over-a-barrel/): Bloomberg reports how Rolls-Royce, which gets [nearly $1 billion a year](http://www.warisbusiness.com/top-150-warcorps/) from the US Defense Department, wound up supplying weapons components to Iran.


> Accounts vary as to how much Iranian money flow into the presidential palace. An Afghan political leader said he believed that [Umar Daudzai, Hamid Karzai’s chief of staff] received between $1 million and $2 million every other month. A former diplomat who served in Afghanistan said sometimes single payments totaled as much as $6 million.
