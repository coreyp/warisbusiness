At the start of the Iraq invasion, the US military spent twice as much on its own personnel as it did on procurement from private sources. Within a few years' time, the military was spending three times as much on outside contractors as on its own men and women in uniform.




That's one tidbit from a 57-page [report](http://opencrs.com/document/RL33110/2010-09-02/?25196) on escalating war spending by US Congressional researchers I mentioned in a [post](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/09/306/) last week, but only got around to reading this morning. Here's another:




<!-- more -->Increased military contracting costs accounted for _half_ of the total rise in war spending between the second half of 2003 and 2008. In that period, the report says, procurement spending increased from $7.2 billion to nearly $62 billion.




[![](/images/2010/10/CRS-procurement-war-spending-budget-chart.jpg)](/images/2010/10/CRS-procurement-war-spending-budget-chart.jpg)The above chart shows how the wartime gravy train has slowed a bit since Obama took over the White Houseâ€”or, as the authors put it, how the "dramatic growth in investment costs [has] moderated."




Note how personnel costs have actually fallen below fiscal year 2004 levels. [Don't forget to file](http://www.herald-review.com/news/local/article_becf2f14-8fed-5a25-8804-ef62f9796004.html) for stop-loss benefits!
