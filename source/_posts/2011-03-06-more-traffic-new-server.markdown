Rising traffic had been making a bloody mess of this site's performance. Good news, though: As of this weekend, W.I.B. has a new webhost, and things are running smoother. 

The server upgrade will ensure that the site stays accessible, and leave a little room for growth. But it also means increased monthly overhead. Please help defray those expenses by making a small [donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=K7AVMBFDT96JA). Thanks!
