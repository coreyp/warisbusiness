[![](/images/2011/04/cp-on-aloyna-apr12-150x111.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6n5WyrKiyg)The Alyona Show had me on yesterday to talk about the US Defense Department's [apparently untouchable](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2064468,00.html) budget, the [Global Day of Action on Military Spending](http://demilitarize.org/) and the [marketing opportunities](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/04/us-libya-arms-idUSTRE7331OO20110404) created by the war in Libya. You can watch the segment on the show's [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6n5WyrKiyg).
