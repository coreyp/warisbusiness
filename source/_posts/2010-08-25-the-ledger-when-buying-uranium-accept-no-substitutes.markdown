> **ledger |ˈlejər|
**_ noun_
** 1 **a book or other collection of financial accounts of a particular type...
** 2 **a flat stone slab covering a grave.


**$5,700 per gram** is evidently the [going rate](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/25/moldova-uranium-smuggling-ring-dirty-bomb) for black-market unenriched uranium. Prices will surely go down if they ever [legalize it](http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-5317-bollywood-boom.html).

**$50 million** was the value of arms sales to Yemen by the US and UK last year, [Amnesty figures](http://www.amnesty.name/en/library/info/MDE31/010/2010/en). Military aircraft, mostly.

**$1.3 billion** is how much the US may spend in the coming year to build [new military bases](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/22/AR2010082201670.html) in Afghanistan. Wait—didn't anyone tell the Pentagon? The withdrawal date is "[firm](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jun/20/white-house-afghanistan-withdrawal-deadline-firm/)."

This weekend, I'll look at who's trying to get in on the base-building business.
