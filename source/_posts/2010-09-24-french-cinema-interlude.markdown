[![](/images/2010/09/micmacs-300x201.jpg)](http://www.sonyclassics.com/micmacs/)I only have 11 minutes of juice on my battery, with no plug in sight, so today's post is has to be quick. I'll make it a weekend culture assignment: [Micmacs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149361/), a film by the director of The City of Lost Children and Amélie.

Within the already small niche of films about the arms trade, it's the only slapstick comedy I'm aware of. None of the Hollywood predictability of Lord of War. Not so pretentious as Syriana. And it makes a point without being too heavy-handed. The silly heist-film vibe is like that of the Ocean's 11 remakes.

I watched Micmacs this week, and enjoyed it. It came out last year in France, and is apparently in [limited release](http://www.sonyclassics.com/micmacs/) in the US.
