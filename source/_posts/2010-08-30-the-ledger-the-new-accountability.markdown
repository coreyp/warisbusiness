**![](/images/2010/08/mr-burns-in-tank-150x150.jpg)$185 million** is how much defective-body armor salesman and hardcore bling addict [David H Brooks](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/08/tents-full-of-hookers/) is on trial for having [allegedly stolen](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/pr/2007/2007oct25.html) through stock fraud. Newsday, the only paper to cover the Brooks trial with any [regularity](http://www.standardbredcanada.ca/news/8-26-10/brooks-trial-reporter-forced-reveal-sources.html), reported last week on "[discord](http://www.newsday.com/long-island/letters-reveal-discord-in-brooks-jury-1.2241567?qr=1)" in the jury—suggesting a [mistrial](http://www.newsday.com/business/judge-again-instructs-bogged-down-brooks-jury-1.2239742) may be on the way. Jury tampering? [It's a possibility](http://www.harnesslink.com/www/Article.cgi?ID=83170).

**$1.6 billion** is how much the US [Missile Defense Agency](http://www.mda.mil/) plans to spend on "advisory and assistance services" in a round of contracts announced today. That's more than one-tenth of the agency's [total budget](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/38334.html). Evidently, the kind of advice that comes [free](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/Why-Ditching-Missile-Defense-Is-for-the-Best-1050) isn't what they want to hear.

**$1 trillion** is a [bargain](http://soundcloud.com/lelink/trillion-dollar-bargain), according to the [voice of Mr. Burns](http://www.harryshearer.com/).
