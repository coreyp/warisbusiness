[![](/images/2010/12/erik-prince-hair-150x113.jpg)](/images/2010/12/erik-prince-hair.jpg)**$17** is how much Blackwater founder Erik Prince pays for haircut, according to a [new profile](http://www.mensjournal.com/an-american-commando-in-exile) in Men's Journal.

**$42 million** is how much Blackwater recently paid for what that magazine describes as "a series of niggling violations." As WIB [coincidentally noted](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/12/former-bush-admin-lawyer-will-keep-tabs-on-blackwater/) yesterday, those "niggling" violations included "hundreds" of egregious breaches of US government regulations against international weapons smuggling.

**$100,000** was the maximum cost of development for each of 13 training [video games](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=269) "designed specifically to enhance acquisition work force education" at the Pentagon's Defense Acquisition University. "In '[Ratner Racing](http://clc.dau.mil/games/game/133),'" for instance, "players can show off their knowledge of rules and regulations."
