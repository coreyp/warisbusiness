[![](/images/2011/11/warbribes-123x150.jpg)](http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18160-war_bribes.html) I have a new cover story over at _Willamette Week_ about a corruption case involving a former civilian official at the U.S. Army Special Operations Command now sitting in federal prison on 35 counts of bribery, extortion and receiving illegal gratuities. [Read it there](http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18160-war_bribes.html).

And keep checking back for updatesâ€”I expect WIB to resume a more regular posting schedule by the end of the year.
