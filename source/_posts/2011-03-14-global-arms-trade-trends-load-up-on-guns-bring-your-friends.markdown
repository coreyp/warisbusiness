The [big headline](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/03/201131464110211223.html) from the latest report on trends in the arms trade, by the [SIPRI](http://www.warisbusiness.com/3516/research/new-report-america-still-no-1-at-something%E2%80%94global-arms-production/) research group, is that India has become the world's top importer of conventional weapons. 

The map above shows the top five arms arms exporting nations, along with their top customers. (The pinpoints for nations are marked by a dot; they share a color with their customers.) 

What it shows is more or less consistent with previous years. But there are signs of a troubling shift in the global marketplace for the tools of violence.

According to SIPRI, the "average volume of worldwide arms transfers in 2006–10 was 24 per cent higher than in 2001–2005." Arms sales have increased dramatically in a short period of time. As if that weren't bad enough:

[![](/images/2011/03/sipri-suppliers-recipients-chart-suppliers-150x113.jpg)](/images/2011/03/sipri-suppliers-recipients-chart-suppliers.jpg)


> The top ﬁve suppliers accounted for 75 per cent of all exports of major conventional weapons in 2006–10, compared with 80 per cent in 2001–2005.


And:

> The overall share of the volume of international arms transfers accounted for by the top ﬁve recipients dropped from 39 per cent in 2001–2005 to 30 per cent in 2006–10.



A greater diversity of suppliers, a broader market of buyers, a significantly higher total sales volume: What's the upshot? 

In a word, proliferation. Public works and welfare are out. Guns and bunkers are in.

As the global economy continues to unravel, food prices climb, joblessness spreads, reactionary movements grow in popularity, long wars of occupation drain Western [blood](http://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/index.php/veterans-category-articles/2174-va) and [treasure](http://costofwar.com/en/), Middle Eastern oligarchies face a wave of popular uprisings, and Far Eastern nations build the [environmentally catastrophic](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/07/china-coal-13-billion-environment.php) [surveillance states](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJkDNmTWxi-exz2kkhIoUZDuPYbw?docId=CNG.94f20013cdd393d22cb9d0a563a113f9.8d1) of the future, the people who control the world's traditional, waning centers of power—national governments—are arming up.

![](/images/2011/02/SIPRI-logo-148x150.jpg)Anecdotally, it seems that the rising centers of power—[corporations](http://www.warisbusiness.com/2637/features/deal-of-the-month/saracen-international-somalia/), transnational political movements—are loading up on guns, too. But those "[non-state transfers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-state_transfers)" beyond the scope of the SIPRI report.
