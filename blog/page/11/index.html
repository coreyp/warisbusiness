  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/obama-singh-toast-300x197.jpg" alt="" />Compared to domestic coverage of Obama&rsquo;s trip to India over the weekend, the South Asian press was generally more <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/118964/the-two-faces-of-barack-obama.html?page=0">forthright</a> about the purpose of the US President&rsquo;s visit: Convincing India to buy military hardware from America <a href="http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/nov/02/slide-show-1-obama-visit-lets-move-india-away-from-russian-weapons.htm">instead of Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Strangely, only Americans seem to think Obama went to India as some kind of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602104,00.html">spendthrift tourist</a>—or consider such a ridiculous idea <a href="http://www.oliverwillis.com/2010/11/04/obama-india-trip-cost-just-made-up-by-conservatives/">even worthy of discussion</a>. The South Asian press, by contrast, does not hesitate to note that Obama arrived, <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/09/hillary-hawks-boeing-gear-to-india/">following his Secretary of State</a>, as a sales agent for top US military contractors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.risingkashmir.com/news/let-obama-sell-weapons-let%E2%80%99s-recast-our-means-3224.aspx">Columns like this one</a> from Rising Kashmir are typical:</p>

<blockquote><p>Obama’s visit has more to do with weapons sales [than politics. His visit] is part of a race world powers are in, to strike a big deal in the history of defence agreements&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover the United States and European nations have already trimmed military spending and the biggest weapons contractors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin see India as a sales lifeline.</p>

<p>If it matters to Americans, it&rsquo;s printed in Srinagar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/manas-transit-center-air-force-detail-150x112.jpg" alt="" />The Washington Post today <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/03/AR2010110307624.html?wprss=rss_nation">reports</a> on the Pentagon&rsquo;s decision to flip the bird to Congressional investigators, or anyone else who questions the way it spends money.</p>

<p>Yesterday, while everyone in America was still preoccupied with the election results, the US Defense Department <a href="http://www.defense.gov//contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4401">announced</a> it would award a fuel contract worth as much as $600 million to Mina Corp., a mysterious company registered in Gibraltar, which has been suspected of facilitating corruption in Central Asia. Mina&rsquo;s ownership is a closely kept secret. But, for some reason, the Pentagon doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Pentagon&rsquo;s dealings with Mina and an associated firm, Red Star Enterprises, have been under investigation for the past six months by the House subcommittee on national security and foreign affairs. Since the Afghan war began, the companies have come from nowhere to win Pentagon contracts worth about $3 billion.</p></blockquote>

<p>This quote, coming from an anonymous source, is priceless:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We understand how it looks. We are trying to change how it looks. &hellip; We are not hiding anything extraordinary,&rdquo; said a senior Defense Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The goal, he said, is &ldquo;maximum transparency.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/buck-mckeon-ike-skelton-150x86.jpg" alt="" />Yesterday&rsquo;s US elections were a win for the military-industrial complex, even though its favorite candidates didn&rsquo;t all keep their jobs.</p>

<p>The top recipient of campaign contributions from military contractors, Missouri Democrat Ike Skelton, lost his reelection bid for the US House of Representatives. Skelton&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/races/contrib.php?cycle=2010&amp;id=MO04">top four contributors</a> in this election were major military contractors: Lockheed Martin ($44,000), General Dynamics ($40,400), Boeing ($23,900), Northrop Grumman ($21,760). His opponent was a Tea Party-backed candidate who was far less dependent on support from the defense industry.</p>

<p>California Republican Buck McKeon, <a href="www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/11/gop-wins-could-mean-showdowns-on-afghanistan-gitmo-dadt/">looks set</a> to replace Skelton as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Guess which industry McKeon&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/races/contrib.php?cycle=2010&amp;id=CA25">biggest backers</a> came from?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a win-win!</p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s electoral outcome doesn&rsquo;t in any way threaten the profits of Pentagon contractors and arms makers. Those companies spent <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2010&amp;ind=D">over $18 million</a> on this election to make sure that would be the case. More than half of that money went to Democrats.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/mulder-scully-homer-150x118.jpg" alt="" />Who knows where it started. With Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, maybe? Regardless, the cult of secrecy went mainstream in the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0928-04.htm">watch-what-[you]-say</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2005/jan/13/the-truth-about-terrorism/">secret-even-in-success</a>&rdquo; days following 9-11.</p>

<p>The cult has, unfortunately, endured.</p>

<p>For a while, there was hope. It seemed the colossal disasters enabled by obsessive secrecy, such as the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/03/iraq.usa1">Curveball</a>&rdquo; fiasco, could inspire a backlash in favor of openness and transparency.</p>

<p>Recent events, however, suggest that the cult of secrecy has grown stronger. For example, many otherwise smart, well-informed people now confuse &ldquo;classified&rdquo; with &ldquo;accurate.&rdquo; Starved of truth too long, they have come to accept the same flawed reasoning that brought us <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/matt-taibbi/blogs/TaibbiData_May2010/193722/83512">Truthers</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/10/GEO-Group-GTMO-migrant-operations-center-150x136.jpg" alt="" />Today&rsquo;s big news in the US: An investigation by NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130833741">reveals</a> that the draconian Arizona immigration law was drafted with help from the private prison industry.</p>

<blockquote><p>The law could send hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to prison in a way never done before. And it could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in profits to private prison companies responsible for housing them.</p></blockquote>

<p>What&rsquo;s the relevance here? The story offers a lesson in the dangers of privatizing essential state functions, such as security. The NPR investigation shows private prison companies using the wealth they&rsquo;ve amassed through government contracts to have laws rewritten in a way that further increases their own power and influence.</p>

<p>What makes this worse than the kind of self-interested lobbying engaged in by, say, agribusiness? The private prison companies can only expand their business by pushing for ever-stricter surveillance and ever-harsher punishments. In short, they profit by waging a kind of war on the population.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/10/DeStorm-pepsi-video-150x106.jpg" alt="" />One of the more distasteful aspects of America&rsquo;s all-volunteer military—particularly when it&rsquo;s entangled in an unpopular war—is the spectacle of highly paid advertising executives devising slick, deceptive marketing campaigns to lure poor and working-class children into enlisting.</p>

<p>The newest such campaign is built around a website: <a href="http://www.myfuture.com/">Myfuture.com</a>, ostensibly a &ldquo;career&rdquo; site aimed at 16-24 year-olds. Tied in with the campaign are two music videos by DeStorm Power, a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_YUqA4sXg">Brooklyn rapper</a>&rdquo; with a popular YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Actually, he&rsquo;s a professional pitchman who tries really hard to bring Bed-Stuy cred to <a href="http://twitter.com/DeStorm/status/28911230604">mainstream megabrands</a>.</p>

<p>DeStorm, whose <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DeStormPower?v=info">Facebook bio</a> makes no mention of military service, but details his art-school credentials, has also rapped on behalf of <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/08/11/2009-08-11_hes_jingling_all_the_way_rapper_rhymes_for_heinz_5g_prize.html">Heinz</a>, KFC, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw53I-zK1Cw">Pepsi</a>, and WinterFresh.</p>

<p>The recruitment videos are titled, subtly, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRNm6r6O-5k&amp;feature=channel">The Good Choice</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8nRIhkctvw&amp;feature=channel">The Bad Choice</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter shows a young man foolishly choosing a life of petty crime, instead of &ldquo;do[ing] right by [his] country.&rdquo; The former—which, notably, has gotten about 100,000 fewer views so far—shows a brighter future for the young man, thanks to the Army.</p>
