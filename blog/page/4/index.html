<h3>AFGHANISTAN</h3>

<blockquote><p>“With Mahmoud at the bank,” the former official went on, “it was seen as an extension of the Karzai family.”</p></blockquote>

<p>••• According to its <a href="http://www.kabulbank.com/html/index.aspx">website</a>, Kabul Bank still offers &ldquo;deposit schemes.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all">They&rsquo;re not kidding</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>To get America out of the war, Petraeus has turned to the network of warlords, drug runners and thieves known as the Afghan government, which the general himself has denounced as a &ldquo;criminal syndicate.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>••• <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/king-davids-war-20110202?print=true">Another must-read by Michael Hastings</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Prosecutor Ian Dixey said the serviceman &ndash; who all worked as &lsquo;air movers&rsquo; loading and unloading military aircraft &ndash; exploited their position of trust to smuggle cigarettes into the UK from Afghanistan and Oman.</p></blockquote>

<p>The conspiracy was discovered when Customs officers searched a plane after it landed at RAF Lyneham and found 90,000 L&amp;M cigarettes from Kabul stashed in a cardboard box.</p>

<p>••• One of the British airmen in this smuggling ring kept &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1353904/3-RAF-servicemen-jailed-smuggling-7m-cigarettes-Middle-East-military-flights.html#ixzz1DGywOSP6">a spreadsheet explaining the scam on his laptop</a>.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/2011/02/tricountywib-logo.jpg"><img src="/images/2011/02/tricountywib-logo-150x75.jpg" alt="" /></a>The other day, I came across a curious solicitation from a quasi-public organization in Western Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s a small thing, really, but it demonstrates how America&#8217;s <a href="http://mondediplo.com/2008/02/05military">militarized economy</a> plays out on the local level. Allow me to translate from the original bureaucratese (<a href="http://tricountywib.org/TCWIB/images/PDFs/news/ITARforManufacturers.pdf">pdf</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>The Tri-County Workforce Investment Board, Inc. (<a href="http://tricountywib.org/TCWIB/">WIB</a>), serving Butler, Armstrong and Indiana Counties, and local employers are aware of the role manufacturing plays in the economy of the local area, the region, and the nation.…</p></blockquote>

<p>The investment board is a government-funded non-profit organization whose leadership is dominated by representatives of industry, along with a handful of union members and bureaucrats (<a href="http://tricountywib.org/TCWIB/images/PDFs/about/localwibmembershiplist.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>

<blockquote><p>As such, the WIB has partnered with the <a href="http://www.armstrongmfg.org/">Tri-County Manufacturing Consortium</a> to develop regional and local plans to assist businesses in remaining competitive in an ever-changing global economy.</p></blockquote>

<p>The consortium? It&rsquo;s a de-facto corporate lobbying organization whose members include a good number of <a href="http://bit.ly/fV0K5s">Defense Department contractors</a>. This passage means that the investment board has asked a bunch of managers how to spend money originally intended to benefit &ldquo;the workforce.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/2011/02/karl-kleber.jpg"><img src="/images/2011/02/karl-kleber-119x150.jpg" alt="" /></a>Earlier this week the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/30/ak47-arms-conspiracy-china-united-states">reported</a> on a US criminal case that offers &ldquo;a rare insight into the byzantine world of international arms brokers.&rdquo; Prosecutors claim that</p>

<blockquote><p>British businessman Gary Hyde and his associate Karl Kleber fraudulently imported more than 5,000 Chinese-produced AK-47 drum magazines into the US from the UK via Germany.</p></blockquote>

<p>The alleged deal backfired, however, after US agents received a tip-off that the drums, each of which holds 75 rounds, had come from China, the subject of a US import ban on weapons.</p>

<p>Kleber, a German citizen who reportedly lives in Portugal, is pictured. The magazines were not intended for commercial sale, but for distribution to Iraqi security forces by US military contractors. The convoluted travels of the magazines is described in the criminal complaint against Hyde, who was arrested January 20 at <a href="www.shotshow.org">this gun show</a> in Las Vegas. The complaint is reproduced below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2011/02/rssfail-114x150.jpg" alt="" />My apologies to those readers whose <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/feed/">RSS subscriptions</a> to this site were overwhelmed with gibberish this morning. The good news is, I&rsquo;m stepping up the news aggregation on War Is Business, which will mean more frequent updates. The bad news is, in fiddling around with the levers and dials behind the curtain, I accidentally published a dozen-odd posts drafts, gunking up this site&rsquo;s feed and quite possibly revealing some state secrets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also added some new navigation features to the right-hand column. The new menus are a little on the ugly side right now, but they aim to make the site more useful as a directory and they will, with time, get prettier.</p>

<blockquote><p>The funds to pay for new unmanned technologies are being reallocated from other programs within the Navy’s budget — part of the &ldquo;efficiencies&rdquo; drill mandated by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.</p></blockquote>

<p>Navy Undersecretary Robert Work said that the department is planning to add $800 million to the budget for the MQ-8B Fire Scout vertical take-off and landing unmanned aircraft program.</p>

<p>••• This is <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/news/rent-a-generals-and-the-militarization-of-the-economy/">the same Fire Scout</a> that the Navy decided to build after extensive lobbying by Northrop Grumman&rsquo;s Rent-A-Generals, then decided it didn&rsquo;t need. Now, the program is <a href="http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=296">back to life</a> with money freed up by Pentagon &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo; Support the troops!</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;[S]upporting the troops” has become a categorical imperative across the political spectrum.  In theory, such support might find expression in a determination to protect those troops from abuse, and so translate into wariness about committing soldiers to unnecessary or unnecessarily costly wars. In practice, however, “supporting the troops” has found expression in an insistence upon providing the Pentagon with open-ended drawing rights on the nation’s treasury, thereby creating massive barriers to any proposal to affect more than symbolic reductions in military spending.</p></blockquote>

<p>••• <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175347/tomgram:_andrew_bacevich,_pentagon,_inc./">Support the Troops!</a>
<img src="/images/2011/01/jon-stewart.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote><p>There is a reverence for the military in the US…that transcends political affiliation and pervades popular culture. On aeroplanes the flight attendant will announce if there are soldiers on board to great applause. When I attended a recording of The Daily Show, John [sic] Stewart made a special point before the show of thanking the servicemen in the audience.</p></blockquote>

<p>But while the admiration for those who serve and die may be deep and widespread, interest in what they are doing and why they are doing it is shallow and fleeting.</p>

<p>••• <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jan/30/afghanistan-us-troops-dying">Seriously: Support the troops! We really, really mean it</a>.</p>

They included a shotgun (with five bullets), a decorative rug and a gilded photo album.</p>

<p>With a confidence that, in retrospect, seems dubious, Gates <a href="http://www.centcom.mil/ur/news/gates-praises-egypt-seeks-saudi-support-in-pakistan">said</a> &ldquo;he looks forward to expanding the two countries’ military-to-military relationships in ways that promote regional stability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five months after that meeting, the Pentagon announced it would sell a new batch of two dozen F-16 fighter aircraft to Egypt—a $3.2 billion deal that is among the most recent of a long string of arms deliveries from America to its North African ally. These F-16s, according to the Pentagon announcement (<a href="http://www.dsca.mil/pressreleases/36-b/2009/Egypt_%2009-34.pdf">pdf</a>) would support &ldquo;Egypt’s legitimate need for its own self-defense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today the Egyptian Air Force <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/930467--fighter-jets-swoop-over-cairo-as-chaos-spreads-prisoners-escape">buzzed</a> a crowd of demonstrators in Cairo with fighter jets much like those supplied, over a period of decades, by the US. It was a tactical decision that bore little relation to &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; national &ldquo;self-defense,&rdquo; although it can be construed as a desperate attempt to defend Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s three-decade hold on the presidency.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2011/01/combined-systems-international-tear-gas-canister-egypt-55x150.jpg" alt="" />Most of the time, mainstream news organizations are loathe to cover the arms trade. Sometimes, though, its consequences are impossible to ignore. This is one of those times. Anyone with internet access can see American weapons, provided to Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s deeply unpopular government, on the other side of what is widely viewed as a democratic uprising.</p>

<p>Following Al Jazeera&rsquo;s <a href="english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/">live reports</a> yesterday of &ldquo;Made in the USA&rdquo;-stamped tear gas canisters being fired on Egyptian protesters, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/28/egypt.us.tear.gas/">CNN</a>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/egypt-protest-police-us-made-tear-gas-demonstrators/story?id=12785598">ABC News</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/01/whats-in-all-that-tear-gas-weve-been-selling-egypt.ars">many</a> <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/01/report-egyptian-police-using-expired-us-tear-gas/1">other</a> <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheat-sheet/item/us-made-tear-gas-fired-in-egypt/foreign-aid/">news</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/28/richard-engel-egypt-tear-gas_n_815647.html">outlets</a> ran stories about the provenance of these reviled crowd-control weapons.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://theatlantic.tumblr.com/post/2979939979/the-associated-press-now-reports-that-the-obama">iconic</a> canisters were manufactured by Combined Systems Inc. of <a href="http://www3.ausa.org/webint/DeptIndustry.nsf/byid/JRAY-72YGQN">bucolic</a> Jamestown, Pennsylvania.

Imagine video of Egyptian protesters being crushed by US-built APCs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it happens, the anti-riot trucks favored by Egyptian police bear the logo of an Italian company, <a href="http://web.iveco.com/Pages/welcome.html#">Iveco SpA</a>.*</p>

<p>Albon&rsquo;s concern is not misplaced, however. The US government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to equip the Egyptian security forces with high-tech military hardware.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2011/01/petraeus-AEI-150x106.jpg" alt="" />US General David Petraeus said this in his &ldquo;state of the Afghan war&rdquo; <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41248475/ns/world_news-south_and_central_asia/">message</a> on Tuesday:</p>

<blockquote><p>[W]e will have to expand our efforts to help Afghan officials implement President Karzai&rsquo;s direction to combat corruption and the criminal patronage networks that undermine the development of effective Afghan institutions. In our support of the latter effort, <strong>we will need to pursue initiatives to ensure that our contracting and procurement activities are part of the solution rather than a continuing part of the problem.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not the NATO Commander&rsquo;s first acknowledgement that America&rsquo;s way of blending war and business has had some counterproductive results. Last September, Petraeus laid out a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/isaf-releases/comisafs-counterinsurgency-coin-contracting-guidance.html">counterinsurgency contracting guidance</a>&rdquo; for procurement officers involved in the Afghan war.</p>

<p>The new instructions read like Consumer Reports For Dummies, offering such elementary prescriptions as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Know those with whom we are contracting.</p></blockquote>

<p>What follows are the official Defense Department totals of overseas arms sales agreements from 1950 through 2009. These are mainly big weapons deals between the US government and the governments of other countries; small arms sales are not included.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2011/01/middle-east-near-asia-cropped.jpg" alt="" />The table offers a simple comparison of worldwide arms sales during that time, and sales to what the Pentagon calls &ldquo;the Near East and South Asia.&rdquo; This super-region corresponds roughly with the Islamic world, as shown by the maps here, minus a few key countries such as Turkey and Indonesia. (The full list of countries is at the end of this post.)</p>
