  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2010/10/SIGAR-logo-145x150.jpg" alt="" />A special US government investigative body just released what it calls the first comprehensive audit of some 7,000 reconstruction contracts in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t an audit of each reconstruction contract. No. It was an audit whose goal was merely to figure out how many contracts have been issued, and for how much.</p>

<p>The takeaway from the 45-page report is that the departments of Defense and State, USAID and other agencies are &ldquo;unable to readily report on how much money they spend&rdquo; on contracts worth nearly $18 billion over two years.</p>

<blockquote><p>The audit shows that navigating the confusing labyrinth of government contracting is difficult, at best. Within the Defense Department alone, there are four contracting organizations managing DOD funded reconstruction contracts. The audit found that not only do those four DOD contracting organizations not coordinate and share information with one another, there is minimal sharing of information across government agencies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Minimal information sharing? Where have we <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site:.gov+%22information+sharing%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=">heard that before</a>?</p>

<p>Also, despite the large number of companies involved in reconstruction, &ldquo;a relatively small number of contractors and other entities accounted for the majority of obligations.&rdquo; For instance, approximately 75 percent of the $2.4 billion in State Department contracts went to one company, <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/tag/dyncorp/">DynCorp International</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2010/10/Harold-W-Gehman-navy-233x300.jpg" alt="" />Academics have done some <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/10/insider-trading-is-legal-for-congressional-insiders.html">fascinating</a> <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2010/06/why-congressional-insider-trading-is-so-profitable.html">work</a> on what amounts to insider trading by members of US Congress and their staff, who are privy to the details of new policies well before the general public. <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/02/good_news_our_s.html">One study</a> found that Senators&#8217; stock portfolios outperformed the market by an average of 12 percent a year.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting, to say the least, to see the results of a similar study assessing the private-sector careers of former military brass.</p>

<p>Corporate boards in the Washington, DC metro area are stuffed with &ldquo;retired&rdquo; generals, admirals and military procurement officers.</p>

<p>Such companies win valuable Defense Department contracts nearly every day, with the help of former officers on their payroll. Those former officers profit from the inside knowledge they gained, and the contacts they made, during their time in uniform.</p>

<p>The most recent example is Admiral Harold W. Gehman, Jr., pictured.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/2010/10/karzai-high.jpg" alt="" />Remember those <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11461795">headlines</a> about Afghan President Hamid Karzai&rsquo;s plan to boot foreign mercenaries from the country? Officially, that&rsquo;s still the plan. Just yesterday the AP <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101025/ap_on_re_as/as_afghanistan_413">reported</a> that Karzai &ldquo;brushed aside appeals from international officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to reverse plans to close private security companies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the fuss, Karzai isn&rsquo;t likely to get his way. In an earlier post, I highlighted some <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/10/bullet-points-for-oct-4-caveat-invader/">massive loopholes</a> in the contractor crackdown, loopholes that were reiterated last week <a href="http://www.bakhtarnews.com.af/en/index.php?news=3307">at a meeting</a> of the Afghan National Security Council.</p>

<p>The new restrictions won&rsquo;t affect mercenaries &ldquo;who are responsible to provide internal security of embassies, movement of foreign diplomats [and] security of military bases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meaning, the rules won&rsquo;t affect anyone doing most of the things private security companies are hired to do.</p>

<p>Besides which, it appears the US military has no intention of abandoning its hired guns. Just check the blasé tone of the US Army procurement officers when asked about Karzai&rsquo;s decree, in this <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=297680ff2a366488db5a8117c3f46848">fresh solicitation</a> for armed security guards at a combat outpost east of Kabul:</div>

Michael] McConnell is now an executive vice-president of Booz Allen Hamilton, a major defense contractor. Two months after McConnell testified before the Senate, Booz Allen Hamilton landed a thirty-four-million-dollar cyber contract.</p></blockquote>

<p>••• Remarkable: In this hacktackular age, some journalists actually check facts and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/25/3047091.htm">don&rsquo;t bring bodyguards</a> to press conferences.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many of the companies apparently felt no sense of accountability. Contractors with a Romanian company called Danubia Global killed three Iraqis in Falluja in 2006, another report said, then refused to answer questions on the episode, citing a company policy not to provide information to investigators.</p></blockquote>

<p>“It is assessed that this drunken group of individuals were out having a good time and firing their weapons,” the incident report concluded.</p>

<p>••• The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24contractors.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">rounds up</a> sketchy contractor-related incidents from the well-coordinated Wikileaks release of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/coreypein/status/28445372961">old US military reports</a> from Iraq.</p>

<blockquote><p>In 2006 and 2007, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/american-iran-embargo-undermined-as-smugglers-show-way-to-ship-made-in-usa.html">McGuinn’s company</a> was negotiating deals worth more than $4 million to purchase 17 helicopter engines from Rolls-Royce in the U.S., according to the indictment. All but two of the dual-use engines reached Iran, according to the Justice Department, and some went to a company the U.S. says is controlled by Iran’s defense ministry.</p></blockquote>

It&rsquo;s like taking the Hot Tub Time Machine back to 2003, except—why does <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/lawrence-donegan-golf-blog/2010/mar/18/golf-tiger-woods-ari-fleischer-lawrence-donegan">Ari Fleischer</a> have hair?</p>

<p>The military reporters in the room asked what were for the  most part good questions. Andrew Shapiro, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, responded with lazy evasions and Bush-era pap.</p>

<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s cynicism is revealed in <a href="http://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/rm/149749.htm">these exchanges</a>. It&rsquo;s betting that the American public, thoroughly distracted by Christine O&#8217;Donnell&rsquo;s anti-onanism and Brett Favre&rsquo;s cock, simply won&rsquo;t care about a seemingly desperate attempt to intimidate Iran and prevent further collapse in the economy.</p>

<p>Watch Shapiro shrug off the suggestion that throwing gasoline over hot coals just maybe might be a bad idea:</p>

<blockquote><p>QUESTION: … At a time when Europe has embarked on big defense cuts, does the fact that the U.S. is involved in so many arms sales to autocratic Middle Eastern countries give you pause about where these arms may be in 10 or 20 or 30 years’ time?</p></blockquote>

<p>ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHAPIRO: &hellip; In terms of where these arms are going to be, I mean, it’s – I’m not sure I fully understand the question…</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so hard to understand? This deal seems destined to serve as a case study on the law of unintended consequences.</p>

<p>The deal was divided into four parts for presentation to Congress <a href="http://www.dsca.mil/sc_news/">and the press</a>.</p>

<p>Turns out the number of rifles in question is not &ldquo;several thousand,&rdquo; as the article I linked to had it, but <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2010/10/20/13/0301000000AEN20101020000100315F.HTML">nearly one million</a>.</p>

<p>The US State Department last year tried to block this massive arms transfer. Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/01/obama-administration-reverses-course-forbids-sale-antique-m-rifles/">quoted</a> a member of the powerful lobby for the firearms industry, the <a href="http://www.nraila.org/legislation/read.aspx?id=6015">National Rifle Association</a>, calling that effort a &ldquo;a de facto gun ban, courtesy of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s State Department.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, a group of 14 Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives—nearly all of whom have taken significant campaign money from the NRA—have endorsed a measure to appease the arms traders.</p>
