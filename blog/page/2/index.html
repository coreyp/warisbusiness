<p>One of the proposed cuts could effectively cripple this website and similar experiments in online journalism.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=35&amp;sid=2327798">Federal News Radio</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The White House requested $35 million for the e-government fund in 2011. The House allocated only $2 million in its bill, H.R. 1. The Senate, meanwhile, would provide $20 million for the e-government fund.</p></blockquote>

<p>The e-government fund pays for some key government transparency websites. The most important of those, as far as War Is Business is concerned, is <a href="http://usaspending.gov/">USASpending.gov</a>, which tracks government contracts. USASpending has a lot of problems, but it remains the go-to source for a decade&rsquo;s worth of federal contract data. It has quickly become a valuable tool not only for journalists, lawyers and bureaucrats, but for small businesses seeking to compete for those contracts.</p>

<p>To my mind, $35 million was already insufficient. Sunlight Foundation policy counsel Daniel Schuman <a href="http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?nid=17&amp;sid=2326141">told FNR</a> that the cuts would ensure that the data on sites like USASpending</p>

<blockquote><p>will slowly go out of date—and finally, as the money runs out, they&rsquo;ll have to pull the plug. <strong>We could see the data disappearing off the internet.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>That is not hyperbole. The stakes here are very high.</p>

<p>Transparency is essential to any government&rsquo;s claim of legitimacy. Without a public accounting of government expenses and revenue, there can be no transparency. Money, as the saying goes, is power. Secret budgets are as democratic as secret laws.</p>

Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the Nike solution applied to everything? If the problem of whether (and how) the outside world should support the anti-Gadhafi forces in Libya were so simple, Obama could just appoint Phil Knight to be the next Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not so simple. When it comes to arming the Libyan rebels, many of the people saying &ldquo;just do it&rdquo; are the same people who were gung-ho about the last couple of American wars. It&rsquo;s not entirely fair to say that the mainstream journalists and overpaid think-tankers who supported the Iraq invasion early on ought to be banned from advising anyone about anything—but, well, they probably ought to be.</p>

<p>As painful as it is to give any number of discredited warmongers a fair hearing, it would be a bigger mistake to treat the horrific situation in Libya as a chance to reenact an eight-year-old domestic political dispute. Any seemingly reflexive stance on the matter—whether in favor of military action or against it—cannot, by definition, be based on an honest evaluation of the unique circumstances in Libya.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always at pains to note that W.I.B. is not an antiwar website—it&rsquo;s an anti-war profiteering website. With that said, to my mind, the anti-intervention camp has produced the most persuasive arguments so far on Libya. There is absolutely no guarantee those arguments will persuade the right people. Indeed, at this point, it appears that Western leaders have already decided in favor of steadily increasing military involvement. Obama has already bypassed Congress to wage a bombing campaign (euphemistically known as the &ldquo;no-fly zone&rdquo;); absent domestic opposition, he is free to escalate as long as the uniformed military can bear the strain.</p>

<p>Keep reading for a brief roundup of the latest takes on the most crucial foreign policy question of 2011 (so far).</p>

<p>And isn&rsquo;t that what happens to most people when <a href="http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/blog-2530-sheriff-solano-resigns_admits-wrongdoing.html">they</a> <a href="http://www.longislandpress.com/2010/10/01/mastic-man-charged-with-welfare-fraud-identity-theft">get caught</a> <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110304/NEWS02/110304009/Vermont-woman-Gambling-led-me-to-embezzle-490-000">blatantly</a> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110328/us_yblog_thelookout/what-does-a-tax-cheat-look-like">ripping off the government</a>?</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t what happened to Sargeant. Ergo, the man is a genius.</p>

<p>Today, the politically connected businessman lives in reclusive luxury in Boca Raton, Florida, thanks in part to the tens of millions of dollars he allegedly personally received from an ill-gotten US military supply contract.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, freelance reporter Penn Bullock and Washington Post writer Kimberly Kindy wrote the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pentagon-overpaid-oilman-millions-audit-finds/2011/03/17/ABQ6VFn_story.html">latest chapter</a> in Sargeant&rsquo;s story. It is a story of egregious misconduct and impunity by a member of the political-military-business elite—a story that may help future historians seeking to understand the advanced rot in the democratic foundations of 21st Century America.</p>

<p>The story opens in 2004, when Sargeant&rsquo;s company, <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/profiles/iotc/">IOTC</a>, won a huge wartime fuel-supply contract for US forces in Iraq. Since then, the government has overpaid Sargeant&rsquo;s company by $200 million, according to a new Pentagon audit report.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/03/201131464110211223.html">big headline</a> from the latest report on trends in the arms trade, by the <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/3516/research/new-report-america-still-no-1-at-something%E2%80%94global-arms-production/">SIPRI</a> research group, is that India has become the world&rsquo;s top importer of conventional weapons.</p>

<p>The map above shows the top five arms arms exporting nations, along with their top customers. (The pinpoints for nations are marked by a dot; they share a color with their customers.)</p>

<p>What it shows is more or less consistent with previous years. But there are signs of a troubling shift in the global marketplace for the tools of violence.</p>

Stanley McChrystal, recently published another <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/another-runaway-general-army-deploys-psy-ops-on-u-s-senators-20110223">controversial piece</a>. This time, he reported on a psychological operations soldier&rsquo;s likely illegal orders to &ldquo;manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastings was criticized for sensationalizing the story. That&rsquo;s a typical fallback complaint when a reporter speaks plainly about something which the people involved with would rather obscure. Hastings&#8217; haters also sidestepped legitimate concerns about the military&rsquo;s attempts to tilt the political process toward courses of action favored by some—but certainly not all—of its leadership.</p>

<p>Fact is, the Rolling Stone piece had an important point to make. And here&rsquo;s another example of military propaganda directed toward a domestic audience. Instead of a PSYOPS team, however, this one involves private contractors.</p>

<h3>AFGHANISTAN</h3>

<blockquote><p>“I recently went on a fact finding mission in Afghanistan with other members of Congress as part of my new role as Chairman of House Armed Services. <a href="http://twitpic.com/4169h2">This picture</a> was taken on that trip with some of the wonderful children of Afghanistan.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>••• Buck McKeon traveled all that way for a photo-op, then ruined it by blinking just as his aide hit the camera shutter.</p>

<blockquote><p>USAID has given $39 million for the reconstruction of schools in Swat but <a href="http://pamirpost.newsvine.mobi/_news/2011/03/04/6190548-reviving-swat-stitch-by-stitch">due to bureaucratic hurdles</a> the transfer of money from centre to the province has been delayed.</p></blockquote>

<p>••• Read: &ldquo;due to corruption.&rdquo; Maybe this calls for a fact-finding mission?</p>

<blockquote><p>In an effort to enhance efficiency and service to its staff, BearingPoint created accounts at Kabul Bank for its 400 local employees. Opening these accounts introduced these Afghans &ndash; most of which had never before been exposed to a financial institution &ndash; to commercial banking systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since then, Afghanistan&rsquo;s introduction to modern commercial banking has come full circle. <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/organizations/kabul-bank/">Kabul Bank</a> has been revealed to the world as an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_filkins">enormous scam</a>, and thousands of Afghan civil servants have been screwed over by the bank&rsquo;s politically-connected shareholders. Likely as not the people who posed for that USAID photo op have gone back to stuffing their Afghanis under the mattress.</p>

<p>Who will undo <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/world/asia/31kabul.html">the damage</a>? Another contractor.</p>
