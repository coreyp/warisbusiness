Imagine video of Egyptian protesters being crushed by US-built APCs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it happens, the anti-riot trucks favored by Egyptian police bear the logo of an Italian company, <a href="http://web.iveco.com/Pages/welcome.html#">Iveco SpA</a>.*</p>

<p>Albon&rsquo;s concern is not misplaced, however. The US government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to equip the Egyptian security forces with high-tech military hardware.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But unless things get really, really bad there, it&rsquo;s unlikely that any big-ticket American military hardware will be used directly against the Egyptian demonstrators. A selection of Defense Department contracts dating to the mid-1990s reveals weapons sales to Egypt that include a Black Hawk helicopters (Sikorsky), a dizzying variety of missiles (Raytheon), Abrams tanks (General Dynamics), Humvees (AM General Corp.) and all manner of ammunition.

<p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2011/01/hosni-mubarak-egypt-132x150.jpg" alt="" />Now, <em>if</em> through some incredible circumstance Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak decides to flee the country, Ã  la <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/people/zine-el-abidine-ben-ali/">Ben Ali</a>, there&rsquo;s a good chance his first-class flight would come courtesy of the American taxpayer.</p>

<p>Pentagon contracts show that the US government has spent at least $111,160,328 to purchase and maintain Mubarak&rsquo;s fleet of nine Gulfstream business jets. (For those keeping score, Gulfstream is a subsidiary of General Dynamics.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.airliners.net/photo/Egypt---Air/Gulfstream-Aerospace-G-IV/0723110/L/"><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2011/01/mubarak-plane.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Amateur planespotters have <a href="http://www.jetphotos.net/viewphoto.php?id=6066699">photographed</a> several of the planes around the world. Mubarak also apparently travels in a Airbus A340; I have no idea who put up the money for that one.</p>

<p>Here are the relevant contract summaries:</p>

<blockquote><p>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., Savannah, Ga., is being awarded a $9,535,315 firm fixed price contract modification to provide for continued fleet maintenance support for <strong>nine Gulfstream aircraft</strong> owned by the Egyptian government.

<li>This tidbit also comes via Twitter, thanks to eagle-eyed Foreign Policy magazine managing editor <a href="http://twitter.com/blakehounshell">Blake Hounshell</a>; Hounshell also noticed a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28diplo.html">report</a> that Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak once &ldquo;commandeered a bus that had been bought with money from the United States Agency for International Development and that had been meant to carry children to school.&rdquo;</li>
