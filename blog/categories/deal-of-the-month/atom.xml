    <updated>2010-11-07T10:00:06+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://coreyp.github.com/warisbusiness/blog/2010/11/07/obama-the-arms-broker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/2010/11/obama-singh-toast-300x197.jpg" alt="" />Compared to domestic coverage of Obama&rsquo;s trip to India over the weekend, the South Asian press was generally more <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/118964/the-two-faces-of-barack-obama.html?page=0">forthright</a> about the purpose of the US President&rsquo;s visit: Convincing India to buy military hardware from America <a href="http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/nov/02/slide-show-1-obama-visit-lets-move-india-away-from-russian-weapons.htm">instead of Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Strangely, only Americans seem to think Obama went to India as some kind of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602104,00.html">spendthrift tourist</a>—or consider such a ridiculous idea <a href="http://www.oliverwillis.com/2010/11/04/obama-india-trip-cost-just-made-up-by-conservatives/">even worthy of discussion</a>. The South Asian press, by contrast, does not hesitate to note that Obama arrived, <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/09/hillary-hawks-boeing-gear-to-india/">following his Secretary of State</a>, as a sales agent for top US military contractors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.risingkashmir.com/news/let-obama-sell-weapons-let%E2%80%99s-recast-our-means-3224.aspx">Columns like this one</a> from Rising Kashmir are typical:</p>

<blockquote><p>Obama’s visit has more to do with weapons sales [than politics. His visit] is part of a race world powers are in, to strike a big deal in the history of defence agreements&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover the United States and European nations have already trimmed military spending and the biggest weapons contractors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin see India as a sales lifeline.</p>

<p>If it matters to Americans, it&rsquo;s printed in Srinagar.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here&rsquo;s another example where, once again, American audiences were given only the bare outlines of a much more disquieting story, lest they start to doubt their government&rsquo;s role in the world.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2010/11/ed-royce.jpg" alt="" />It begins with a November 1 <a href="http://www.royce.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=213546">press release</a> from US Rep. Ed Royce (D-California), advocating for increased US &ldquo;defense cooperation&rdquo; with India in advance of Obama&rsquo;s trip there. Who could oppose something so gentle-sounding as &ldquo;cooperation&rdquo;? But a letter quoted at length by the Press Trust of India makes clear that <a href="http://business-standard.com/india/news/getbig-pie-outindia/s-defense-market-royce-to-obama/114397/on">Royce gave far more explicit</a> instructions to the <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/November/20101106110917yggep0.0873791.html">Salesman-in-Chief</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As you know, six foreign companies are competing to sell India 126 new multi-role combat aircraft in a deal that could be worth as much as $11 billion. India&rsquo;s selection process for this aircraft is advancing, with two US companies under active consideration,&rdquo; senior Republican lawmaker from California Ed Royce said in a letter to Obama&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Royce, in his letter of October 26, said heads of state from France, Russia and the United Kingdom were moving aggressively to advocate for their countries' aircraft proposal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moving India away from its tradition of purchasing Russian equipment toward a US supplier would provide New Delhi with the best product, enhance Indian military&rsquo;s role in the region and improve interaction amongst our militaries,&rdquo; he wrote&hellip;</p>

<p>Royce, who has put himself forward as a candidate for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, took <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/pacs.php?cycle=2010&amp;cid=N00008264&amp;sector=D&amp;seclong=Defense&amp;newMem=N">at least $24,000</a> from defense industry political action committees in the just-finished 2010 election cycle. (Obama took more than $1 million from the industry for his 2008 campaign.)</p>

<p>To be fair, the US media didn&rsquo;t completely ignore the real reason for Obama&rsquo;s trip—they just tended to gloss over the details of the transaction in favor of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/06/obamas-asian-trip-itinera_n_779749.html#s176327">happier angles</a>.</p>

<p>CNN.com—at least, its <a href="http://www.theonion.com/video/time-announces-new-version-of-magazine-aimed-at-ad,17950/">adult-friendly</a> international edition—made <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/06/india.obama.trip/?hpt=T1">prominent mention</a> of &ldquo;a $4.1 billion agreement for the Indian air force to purchase 10 C-17 military transport planes from Boeing, which the White House said will support more than 22,000 jobs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a November 6 <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/November/20101106110917yggep0.0873791.html">speech</a>, Obama described those planes as &ldquo;commercial and cargo aircraft,&rdquo; which sound less, well, warlike. The photo below shows US Air Force paratroopers jumping from a C-17 during <a href="http://www.ramstein.af.mil/photos/mediagallery.asp?galleryID=1784">NATO exercises</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2010/11/c-17-paratrooper-drop1.jpg"><img src="/images/2010/11/c-17-paratrooper-drop1-300x199.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Politico <a href="http://mobile.politico.com/story.cfm?id=44777&amp;cat=topnews">quoted</a> Boeing chairman W. James McNerney, who</p>

<blockquote><p>told reporters in Mumbai that Obama’s advocacy on behalf of his and other American companies was a key. “Having the president here, it helps,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anybody have a problem with the President as corporate pitchman? No? Granted, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033002922.html">nothing new</a>. Okay, moving on&hellip;</p>

<p>The New York Times had the least piecemeal take, devoting an entire story to India as a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/05defense.html?ref=world&amp;pagewanted=all">rich arms market</a>.&rdquo; But the Times left no room for critics of arms proliferation, treating advanced weapons as just another commodity, no different than rice or laptop computers.</p>

<p>For criticism of Obama&rsquo;s mission, you had to seek out a paper like <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/118964/the-two-faces-of-barack-obama.html?page=0">India Today</a>, which offers a thorough, if somewhat nationalistic, analysis of US policy in South Asia. The authors say America&rsquo;s practice of charging India for advanced weaponry while practically donating similar gear to Pakistan—all the while knowing that Pakistani intelligence aids the Taliban—"takes the last bit of morality out of Obama&rsquo;s war in Afghanistan."</p>

<blockquote><p>Since 2001, Pakistan has received $3.2 billion in US military assistance for the war on terror. Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden do not have a navy or an air force; yet 90 per cent of Pakistan&rsquo;s defence acquisitions have been fighter aircraft, anti-ship missiles, anti-tank helicopters and missiles and long range maritime patrol aircraft&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>The US aid is being used to gradually whittle down India&rsquo;s conventional military advantage.</p>

<p>The more weapons the US gives to Pakistan, the more India wants to buy, lest it lose its edge. Exporting weapons may not promote &ldquo;<a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/10/saudi-arms-deal-nothing-could-possibly-go-wrong/">stability</a>,&rdquo; but it sure does boost demand.</p>

    <updated>2010-10-28T12:50:34+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://coreyp.github.com/warisbusiness/blog/2010/10/28/new-us-army-pitch-enlist-today-hey-it-beats-prison</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/2010/10/DeStorm-pepsi-video-150x106.jpg" alt="" />One of the more distasteful aspects of America&rsquo;s all-volunteer military—particularly when it&rsquo;s entangled in an unpopular war—is the spectacle of highly paid advertising executives devising slick, deceptive marketing campaigns to lure poor and working-class children into enlisting.</p>

<p>The newest such campaign is built around a website: <a href="http://www.myfuture.com/">Myfuture.com</a>, ostensibly a &ldquo;career&rdquo; site aimed at 16-24 year-olds. Tied in with the campaign are two music videos by DeStorm Power, a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_YUqA4sXg">Brooklyn rapper</a>&rdquo; with a popular YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Actually, he&rsquo;s a professional pitchman who tries really hard to bring Bed-Stuy cred to <a href="http://twitter.com/DeStorm/status/28911230604">mainstream megabrands</a>.</p>

<p>DeStorm, whose <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DeStormPower?v=info">Facebook bio</a> makes no mention of military service, but details his art-school credentials, has also rapped on behalf of <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/08/11/2009-08-11_hes_jingling_all_the_way_rapper_rhymes_for_heinz_5g_prize.html">Heinz</a>, KFC, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw53I-zK1Cw">Pepsi</a>, and WinterFresh.</p>

<p>The recruitment videos are titled, subtly, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRNm6r6O-5k&amp;feature=channel">The Good Choice</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8nRIhkctvw&amp;feature=channel">The Bad Choice</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter shows a young man foolishly choosing a life of petty crime, instead of &ldquo;do[ing] right by [his] country.&rdquo; The former—which, notably, has gotten about 100,000 fewer views so far—shows a brighter future for the young man, thanks to the Army.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t join the military: Knock up your nagging girlfriend, go to prison.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2010/10/DeStorm-MyFuture-ad-video-150x92.jpg" alt="" />Join the military: Marry a hottie, qualify for a mortgage, win a couple of war medals.</p>

<p>As simple as the choice seems, in these videos, the truth is somewhat <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/us/17bcvets.html">more complicated</a>.  Any honest enlistment pitch would have to include the experience of tens of thousands of veterans <a href="http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-4226-its-not-over.html">like this one</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Joe Callan, 30, left the Marine Corps in February, after three tours in Iraq in which he lost more friends than he cares to count. Now he lives with his wife, a University of New Mexico nursing student, and two daughters, in an asbestos-ridden campus apartment that reminds him of base housing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, Callan thinks about that famous picture from V-J Day, 1945, of the sailor kissing the nurse. There will be no V-I Day, 2009.</p>

<p>“If the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were to end today, nobody’d give a shit. Nobody’d even notice,” he says&hellip;</p>

<p>As Callan says, “shooting shit” doesn’t translate well to civilian life. The New Mexico Department of Veterans Services points vets to its “featured employer,” Walmart.</p>

<p>“Fuck Walmart,” Callan says.</p>

<p>The Myfuture.com <a href="http://www.defense.gov//releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14012">campaign</a>, <a href="http://www.defense.gov//news/newsarticle.aspx?id=61441">announced today</a>, is sponsored by the Department of Defense Joint Advertising Market Research and Studies program.</p>

<p>The website itself is registered to <a href="http://www.mullen.com/about/">Mullen Advertising</a>. Earlier this year, Mullen won a <a href="http://usaspending.gov/explore?carryfilters=on&amp;overridecook=yes&amp;fromfiscal=yes&amp;tab=By+Prime+Awardee&amp;typeofview=complete&amp;comingfrom=searchresults&amp;frompage=contracts&amp;modnumber=0&amp;transactionnumber=0&amp;idvpiid=W91WAW07D0012&amp;piid=0046&amp;fiscal_year=2010&amp;pop_state=MA&amp;maj_contracting_agency=97&amp;mod_agency=2100&amp;contractorid=2405409&amp;record_id=45748806">$2.4 million advertising services contract</a> with the Army.</p>

<p>The agency is a subsidiary of the publicly traded <a href="http://www.interpublic.com/companyfinder/companydetail?company=31&amp;cname=Mullen">Interpublic Group</a>, whose chairman and CEO, Michael I. Roth, made <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/12/boss-10_Michael-I-Roth_JYP5.html">$6.3 million</a> last year.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the lobby of Mullen&rsquo;s new offices in Boston, pictured on the agency&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mullenadvertising">Flickr page</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2010/10/mullen-advertising-boston-lobby-300x198.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beats a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/walter-reed/index.html">moldy VA hospital</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s Mullen&rsquo;s president and CEO, Joe Grimaldi, pictured in a Boston Herald photo, throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park.</p>

<p>Maybe &ldquo;The Good Choice&rdquo; is to skip the military and go into advertising.</p>

    <link href="http://coreyp.github.com/warisbusiness/blog/2010/09/23/obama-arms-deal/"/>
    <updated>2010-09-23T09:58:34+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://coreyp.github.com/warisbusiness/blog/2010/09/23/obama-arms-deal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/2010/09/obama-abdullah-saudi.jpg" alt="" />He didn&rsquo;t exactly campaign on peace, but who expected Barack Obama to sign off on the largest US arms deal in history less than halfway into his first term as President?</p>

<p>The planned $60 billion deal with Saudi Arabia has been in the works for awhile, but has made fresh headlines around the world following a Wall Street Journal story <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704621204575488361149625050.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_MIDDLESecondStories">last week</a>.</p>

<p>The WSJ led with Obama&rsquo;s likely pitch: It&rsquo;s about jobs.</p>

<p>That explanation <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4c736722-c4de-11df-9134-00144feab49a.html">wasn&rsquo;t enough</a> <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/09/201091312118406560.html">for journalists</a> forced to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/israels-silence-over-saudi-arms-deal-speaks-volumes/article1707803/">follow up</a> the story, including the Atlantic, which says: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/understanding-the-60-billion-saudi-arms-deal-its-all-about-iran/63280/">It&rsquo;s About Iran</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suspect the WSJ&rsquo;s straightforward version is closer to the truth, substituting the Washington code word &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; for &ldquo;massive government spending, a small portion of which may trickle down to the corporate workforce.&rdquo; Couldn&rsquo;t this well-publicized $60 billion arms deal simply be about <em>SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS</em>?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The press is calling it the biggest arms deal ever, although I suspect that reckoning excludes the value of nuclear cooperation agreements and other similarly hard-to-calculate exchanges.</p>

<p>To add some context to that figure, $60 billion is in the ballpark of the state budget of Texas and the annual revenue of Apple Computer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about one-twelfth the size of Obama&rsquo;s economic stimulus package, which was supposed to put tens of thousands of laid-off Americans back to work.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s nearly double the value of all arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia in the past seven years.</p>

<p>That last figure comes from a Sept. 10 Congressional Research Service report, &ldquo;Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 2002-2009&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R41403.pdf">pdf</a>). During that period of time, Saudi Arabia was the world&rsquo;s top buyer of weapons in the non-Western world, and the US was the top seller.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2010/09/crs-arms-sales-customers-02-09.jpg"><img src="/images/2010/09/crs-arms-sales-customers-02-09.jpg" alt="" /></a>Egypt and Israel have also been major customers, as this chart shows.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2010/09/crs-arms-sales-dealers-06-09.jpg"><img src="/images/2010/09/crs-arms-sales-dealers-06-09.jpg" alt="" /></a>Save for half a billion dollars in deliveries from Russia and China, Iran was frozen out of the arms market, even as the US and Western European countries supplied the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s neighbors with billions of dollars worth of warships, military aircraft and missile defense systems.</p>

<p>So, Atlantic contributor Jonathan Tepperman is correct when he writes that the $60 billion deal with Saudi Arabia is about the US posture toward Iran.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand why Tepperman finds it &ldquo;particularly striking&rdquo; that the sale comes in a year when US arms sales are down by 9 percent.</p>

<p>The timing of the sale makes a lot of sense, if you take the Obama administration at its word. From the WSJ:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big economic sale for the U.S. and the argument is that it is better to create jobs here than in Europe,&rdquo; said one person close to the talks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Boeing Co., which makes the F-15s, the Apaches and the Little Birds [to be sold], believes the Saudi package would directly or indirectly support 77,000 jobs across 44 states.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the genius of the military-industrial complex—the system spreads the financial rewards of war production across hundreds of Congressional districts, handicapping any political opposition to new military spending.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s more context on the decline in US weapons sales, from the CRS report cited above:</p>

<blockquote><p>Worldwide weapons orders fell in 2009. The total of $57.5 billion, was a decrease from $62.8 billion in 2008, or 8.5%. Yet for the United States, the decline in its value and share of worldwide United States weapons agreements total in 2009 was (<strong>$22.6 billion</strong> or 39.3%) <strong>falling from $38.1 billion</strong> or 60.1% in 2008. These lower U.S. figures can be generally attributed to the number of high value arms transfer agreements signed in 2008; totals not usually duplicated two years in a row.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, in order to maintain a high level of weapons production—which, in turns, props up local economies around the US—a big foreign sale such as this was necessary.</p>

<p>So, commentators, put your global chessboards aside for a moment. This deal is Obama&rsquo;s effort to buoy the national economy, and thus help his party&rsquo;s chances in future election years, without proposing any major changes to US foreign or economic policy.</p>

<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s probably short-sighted. Politically, however, the deal is an obvious winner for Obama. The Saudi aircraft orders will keep Boeing&rsquo;s production lines humming for a few more years—and who will be upset about it, except for a few peacenik voters, and any unfortunate collateral damage-to-be?</p>
