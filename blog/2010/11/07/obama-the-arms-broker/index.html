<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/obama-singh-toast-300x197.jpg" alt="" />Compared to domestic coverage of Obama&rsquo;s trip to India over the weekend, the South Asian press was generally more <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/118964/the-two-faces-of-barack-obama.html?page=0">forthright</a> about the purpose of the US President&rsquo;s visit: Convincing India to buy military hardware from America <a href="http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/nov/02/slide-show-1-obama-visit-lets-move-india-away-from-russian-weapons.htm">instead of Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Strangely, only Americans seem to think Obama went to India as some kind of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,602104,00.html">spendthrift tourist</a>—or consider such a ridiculous idea <a href="http://www.oliverwillis.com/2010/11/04/obama-india-trip-cost-just-made-up-by-conservatives/">even worthy of discussion</a>. The South Asian press, by contrast, does not hesitate to note that Obama arrived, <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/09/hillary-hawks-boeing-gear-to-india/">following his Secretary of State</a>, as a sales agent for top US military contractors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.risingkashmir.com/news/let-obama-sell-weapons-let%E2%80%99s-recast-our-means-3224.aspx">Columns like this one</a> from Rising Kashmir are typical:</p>

<blockquote><p>Obama’s visit has more to do with weapons sales [than politics. His visit] is part of a race world powers are in, to strike a big deal in the history of defence agreements&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover the United States and European nations have already trimmed military spending and the biggest weapons contractors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin see India as a sales lifeline.</p>

<p>If it matters to Americans, it&rsquo;s printed in Srinagar.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here&rsquo;s another example where, once again, American audiences were given only the bare outlines of a much more disquieting story, lest they start to doubt their government&rsquo;s role in the world.</p>

<p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/ed-royce.jpg" alt="" />It begins with a November 1 <a href="http://www.royce.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=213546">press release</a> from US Rep. Ed Royce (D-California), advocating for increased US &ldquo;defense cooperation&rdquo; with India in advance of Obama&rsquo;s trip there. Who could oppose something so gentle-sounding as &ldquo;cooperation&rdquo;? But a letter quoted at length by the Press Trust of India makes clear that <a href="http://business-standard.com/india/news/getbig-pie-outindia/s-defense-market-royce-to-obama/114397/on">Royce gave far more explicit</a> instructions to the <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/November/20101106110917yggep0.0873791.html">Salesman-in-Chief</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As you know, six foreign companies are competing to sell India 126 new multi-role combat aircraft in a deal that could be worth as much as $11 billion. India&rsquo;s selection process for this aircraft is advancing, with two US companies under active consideration,&rdquo; senior Republican lawmaker from California Ed Royce said in a letter to Obama&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Royce, in his letter of October 26, said heads of state from France, Russia and the United Kingdom were moving aggressively to advocate for their countries&#8217; aircraft proposal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moving India away from its tradition of purchasing Russian equipment toward a US supplier would provide New Delhi with the best product, enhance Indian military&rsquo;s role in the region and improve interaction amongst our militaries,&rdquo; he wrote&hellip;</p>

<p>Royce, who has put himself forward as a candidate for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, took <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/pacs.php?cycle=2010&amp;cid=N00008264&amp;sector=D&amp;seclong=Defense&amp;newMem=N">at least $24,000</a> from defense industry political action committees in the just-finished 2010 election cycle. (Obama took more than $1 million from the industry for his 2008 campaign.)</p>

<p>To be fair, the US media didn&rsquo;t completely ignore the real reason for Obama&rsquo;s trip—they just tended to gloss over the details of the transaction in favor of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/06/obamas-asian-trip-itinera_n_779749.html#s176327">happier angles</a>.</p>

<p>CNN.com—at least, its <a href="http://www.theonion.com/video/time-announces-new-version-of-magazine-aimed-at-ad,17950/">adult-friendly</a> international edition—made <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/06/india.obama.trip/?hpt=T1">prominent mention</a> of &ldquo;a $4.1 billion agreement for the Indian air force to purchase 10 C-17 military transport planes from Boeing, which the White House said will support more than 22,000 jobs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a November 6 <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2010/November/20101106110917yggep0.0873791.html">speech</a>, Obama described those planes as &ldquo;commercial and cargo aircraft,&rdquo; which sound less, well, warlike. The photo below shows US Air Force paratroopers jumping from a C-17 during <a href="http://www.ramstein.af.mil/photos/mediagallery.asp?galleryID=1784">NATO exercises</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/c-17-paratrooper-drop1.jpg"><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/c-17-paratrooper-drop1-300x199.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Politico <a href="http://mobile.politico.com/story.cfm?id=44777&amp;cat=topnews">quoted</a> Boeing chairman W. James McNerney, who</p>

<blockquote><p>told reporters in Mumbai that Obama’s advocacy on behalf of his and other American companies was a key. “Having the president here, it helps,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anybody have a problem with the President as corporate pitchman? No? Granted, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033002922.html">nothing new</a>. Okay, moving on&hellip;</p>

<p>The New York Times had the least piecemeal take, devoting an entire story to India as a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/05defense.html?ref=world&amp;pagewanted=all">rich arms market</a>.&rdquo; But the Times left no room for critics of arms proliferation, treating advanced weapons as just another commodity, no different than rice or laptop computers.</p>

<p>For criticism of Obama&rsquo;s mission, you had to seek out a paper like <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/118964/the-two-faces-of-barack-obama.html?page=0">India Today</a>, which offers a thorough, if somewhat nationalistic, analysis of US policy in South Asia. The authors say America&rsquo;s practice of charging India for advanced weaponry while practically donating similar gear to Pakistan—all the while knowing that Pakistani intelligence aids the Taliban—&#8221;takes the last bit of morality out of Obama&rsquo;s war in Afghanistan.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>Since 2001, Pakistan has received $3.2 billion in US military assistance for the war on terror. Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden do not have a navy or an air force; yet 90 per cent of Pakistan&rsquo;s defence acquisitions have been fighter aircraft, anti-ship missiles, anti-tank helicopters and missiles and long range maritime patrol aircraft&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>The US aid is being used to gradually whittle down India&rsquo;s conventional military advantage.</p>

<p>The more weapons the US gives to Pakistan, the more India wants to buy, lest it lose its edge. Exporting weapons may not promote &ldquo;<a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/10/saudi-arms-deal-nothing-could-possibly-go-wrong/">stability</a>,&rdquo; but it sure does boost demand.</p>
