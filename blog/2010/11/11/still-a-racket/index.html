<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/armistice-day-dover.jpg"><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/armistice-day-dover.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Earlier this week I <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/11/beer-for-bullets-privatization-meets-prohibition/">posted</a> a small excerpt from &ldquo;War Is A Racket,&rdquo; a 1935 pamphlet by Smedley Butler, one of the most decorated men ever to serve in the US Marine Corps. Today—Armistice Day—is a fine occasion to share more about why this warrior eventually disclaimed the enterprise.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind as you read Butler&rsquo;s accounting of World War I profiteering:</p>

<p>In 2001, the revenues of the largest US defense contractor, <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/11/lockheed/">Lockheed Martin</a>, totaled just under $24 billion a year, and its operating profit came to $888 million. By the end of 2009, Lockheed&rsquo;s annual revenues were $45 billion, not quite double where they were before the invasions and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. But now, the company is making nearly six times its pre-war profits—$5.2 billion a year.</p>

<p>Not bad, as Butler said.</p>

<p><img src="/warisbusiness/images/2010/11/smedley-butler-268x300.jpg" alt="" />From &ldquo;<a href="http://www.scuttlebuttsmallchow.com/racket.html">War Is A Racket</a>&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote><p>The World War, rather our brief participation in it, has cost the United States some $52,000,000,000. Figure it out. That means $400 to every American man, woman, and child. And we haven&rsquo;t paid the debt yet. We are paying it, our children will pay it, and our children&rsquo;s children probably still will be paying the cost of that war.</p></blockquote>

<p>The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are six, eight, ten, and sometimes twelve percent. But war-time profits – ah! that is another matter – twenty, sixty, one hundred, three hundred, and even eighteen hundred per cent – the sky is the limit. All that traffic will bear. Uncle Sam has the money. Let&rsquo;s get it.</p>

<p>Of course, it isn&rsquo;t put that crudely in war time. It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and &ldquo;we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,&rdquo; but the profits jump and leap and skyrocket – and are safely pocketed. Let&rsquo;s just take a few examples:</p>

<p>Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people – didn&rsquo;t one of them testify before a Senate committee recently that their powder won the war? Or saved the world for democracy? Or something? How did they do in the war? They were a patriotic corporation. Well, the average earnings of the du Ponts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6,000,000 a year. It wasn&rsquo;t much, but the du Ponts managed to get along on it. Now let&rsquo;s look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918. Fifty-eight million dollars a year profit we find! Nearly ten times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good. An increase in profits of more than 950 per cent.</p>

<p>Take one of our little steel companies that patriotically shunted aside the making of rails and girders and bridges to manufacture war materials. Well, their 1910-1914 yearly earnings averaged $6,000,000. Then came the war. And, like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making. Did their profits jump – or did they let Uncle Sam in for a bargain? Well, their 1914-1918 average was $49,000,000 a year!</p>

<p>Or, let&rsquo;s take United States Steel. The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105,000,000 a year. Not bad. Then along came the war and up went the profits. The average yearly profit for the period 1914-1918 was $240,000,000. Not bad. &hellip;</p>

<p>The Administration names a committee – with the War and Navy Departments ably represented under the chairmanship of a Wall Street speculator – to limit profits in war time. To what extent isn&rsquo;t suggested. Hmmm. Possibly the profits of 300 and 600 and 1,600 per cent of those who turned blood into gold in the World War would be limited to some smaller figure.</p>

<p>Apparently, however, the plan does not call for any limitation of losses – that is, the losses of those who fight the war. As far as I have been able to ascertain there is nothing in the scheme to limit a soldier to the loss of but one eye, or one arm, or to limit his wounds to one or two or three. Or to limit the loss of life.</p>
